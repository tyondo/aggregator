General Overview</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc446436152\"></a>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This purpose of this manual is to provide a framework for the management of credit risk throughout the Institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It outlines the credit practices throughout Musoni to assure sound credit risk underwriting standards, a thorough credit approval process, thoughtful credit administration procedures and a strong comprehensive credit review process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The manual has seven sections, the first is an overall introduction of the manual, the second contains the policies that are applicable to all the Musoni products, the third section contains the credit policies that will guide in group lending methodology, while the fourth section has the individual lending policies. The fifth section has policies that are applicable to the Agricultural lending, where for this product the group and individual lending methodologies will apply with deviation being the loan appraisal process. The sixth and seventh sections cover Musoni, Social Performance management and environmental policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc446436153\"></a><a name=\"_Toc446405750\"></a><a name=\"_Toc446405893\"></a><a name=\"_Toc446406108\"></a><a name=\"_Toc446406329\"></a><a name=\"_Toc446406545\"></a><a name=\"_Toc446405751\"></a><a name=\"_Toc446405894\"></a><a name=\"_Toc446406109\"></a><a name=\"_Toc446406330\"></a><a name=\"_Toc446406546\"></a>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definition</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For the purpose of this Manual, Credit Risk is the risk to Earnings and/or Capital, arising from the borrower&rsquo;s failure to meet the terms of any credit contract or otherwise fail to perform as agreed. Credit Risk can also be defined as the risk of loss arising from counter party default.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit Risk management is a process. It begins with identification of the markets to which the Musoni desires to lend and proceeds through a series of stages, appraisal, approval, documentation, disbursement, portfolio management and loan repayment. All these stages must be properly managed if Musoni&rsquo;s exposure to credit risk is to be optimized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Credit Policy Manual sets objective standards and parameters that guide Musoni officers in the granting of loans and management of the loan portfolio.&nbsp; This Policy is set to establish a framework within which the Credit Risk arising from lending will be originated and managed in order to minimize the risk of financial loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A separate Credit Procedures Manual has been prepared to cover the day-to-day processes and operational procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of the procedures presented in the Credit Procedures Manual have been summarized into Workflow Charts to help WCOs with the more common processes.

Prior to loan application, the WCO shall inform the client of Musoni&rsquo;s environmental exclusion list. Any potential customer who contravenes this policy shall not be financed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the application and appraisal process, the WCO shall make an evaluation of the environmental and social risks associated with the business. As part of this evaluation process, the WCO assigns the borrower&rsquo;s economic activities to one of the following environmental risk categories: low risk, limited risk, medium risk or high risk. This risk categorization is based on the classification of environmental risk by main economic activity. Loans greater than KSh 100,000 and falling in limited and medium risk categories shall undergo additional environmental assessments. Additional assessment shall also apply to all loans in the high-risk category, regardless of amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No additional environmental assessment is carried out on loans in the low risk category, or on loans in the limited and medium categories, whose amounts are less than KSh 100,000 equivalent.&nbsp; Based on the results of the assessment, a brief environmental information memo is prepared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the environmental and social risk evaluation, the WCO will explain to the customer that he/she is expected to comply with the environmental, health and safety requirements of Musoni relevant to the activity being financed.&nbsp; If there appears to be an inconsistency with these requirements, the loan is either rejected or corrective action is agreed as a condition of the loan.&nbsp; If a loan is rejected due to environmental grounds or corrective action is agreed, the Environmental Coordinator must be informed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni&rsquo;s loan agreements contain a general clause stating that the customer is familiar with the environmental exclusion list of Musoni and that the customer affirms that he/she does not pursue any of the economic activities enumerated in the exclusion list. The loan agreements also contain a clause stating that the customer, to the best of their knowledge, is familiar with the applicable environmental, health and safety requirements of Musoni and that he/she assures that his/her enterprise is operated in compliance with these requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During supervision visits, the WCO observes the borrower&#39;s activities with an eye toward identifying poor environmental or social performance, opportunities for improvement, or improvements made since the last visit.&nbsp; Performance and opportunities are discussed with the borrower as appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni evaluates its environmental and social performance on an annual basis.&nbsp; The institution provides an annual report on environmental and social performance and compliance to the Board of Directors and to shareholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc446436268\"></a><a name=\"_Toc441592037\"></a><a name=\"_Toc441591777\"></a><a name=\"_Toc440142225\"></a><a name=\"_Toc377454069\"></a>7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Introduction</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc429063768\"></a>1.1 Background</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to various worldwide terrorist and other criminal activities, the international community through bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force [FATF] has sought to ensure that the global financial network is not used to facilitate criminal activity. In this regard, the FATF has issued a number of recommendations that are now widely recognized as standards for combating money laundering and financing of terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FATF has 5 FATF-style regional bodies [FSRB] and more than 15 other international organizations or bodies. Kenya is a member of one of the FSRB i.e. Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group [ESAAMLG]. Kenya also happens to be a signatory to the major international protocols relating to anti-money laundering [AML], corruption, trans-national crime and combating terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Kenya, the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2009 is the key legislation on AML and KYC matters. The Central Bank of Kenya also issues various guidelines and regulatory requirements that all financial services organizations in Kenya should comply with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni, being a responsible player in the Kenya financial services sector, strives to comply with all laws and regulatory guidelines and adhere to sound financial service practices, both locally and internationally. It must also be noted that failure to comply with any of the laws or regulations relating to money laundering and KYC by any of our staff constitutes a criminal offence, whether or not money laundering has taken place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to penalties for breaches, any involvement in money laundering activities would cause severe damage to our Company&rsquo;s reputation and substantially jeopardize the future of our business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc429063769\"></a>1.2 Scope</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This manual contains policies and procedures for prudent customer identification, record keeping, identification of suspicious activities and the process for reporting such activities both internally and externally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These policies and procedures apply to all functions, departments, branches and employees of Musoni as well as to all transactions entered into by Musoni with any customer, regardless of whether that person is an account holder at Musoni or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc429063770\"></a>1.3 Compliance</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This manual explains policies and procedures relating to AML and KYC matters that all Musoni employees must comply with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the policies/procedures explained in this document are found to be in conflict or inconsistent with any other previously written internal policies/procedures, the content of this manual will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this manual assigns responsibilities to various roles e.g. Wealth Creation Officer and AML Compliance Officer, such responsibilities can also be undertaken by any official legitimately holding such a role in an acting capacity. The responsibilities may also be performed by any official specifically designated by the CEO/COO to perform such duties at any one time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the responsibility of the respective Branch Managers and Heads of Departments in Head Office to ensure that these policies and procedures are fully complied with in their respective areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should you encounter any challenges in complying with a requirement contained in this manual, please refer to your up-line manager who should in turn refer the matter to the CFO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NB:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Any dispensation to deviate from laid down policies

the CFO in writing detailing the required changes/amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CFO is responsible for ensuring the manual remains up-to-date at all

General overview</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196926\"></a>1.1 Introduction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This document sets-out the guidelines and standards that are applied to the Musoni branch selection and outfitting process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196927\"></a>1.2 Musoni&rsquo;s branch idea</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni&rsquo;s branch idea is based on two elements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Brick and mortar presence is important in building brand recognition and credibility in the market, in particular when Musoni is entering a new area</li>\r\n	<li>Musoni&rsquo;s mobile phone approach means that Musoni branches can serve a far larger catchment area than traditional MFI-branches as clients are not expected to travel frequently to branches to handle payments or withdrawals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this reason, Musoni adopts a branch led approach whereby branches are opened in strategic areas and where each branch is expected to service at least 4,500 clients (in comparison to 3,000 at some of the Musoni competitors).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196928\"></a>1.3 Branch purposes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While Musoni branches will not facilitate cash deposits, repayments or withdrawals, the branches do serve three distinct uses:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Community marketing: Musoni&rsquo;s branches should be visible, highlighting Musoni&rsquo;s presence in the community and demonstrating to existing and prospective clients the stability of banking with Musoni</li>\r\n	<li>Customer service: Musoni branches are intended to attract high footfall and should be equipped to make clients feel welcome</li>\r\n	<li>Staff working area: Musoni relies upon high levels of customer interaction. This can only be achieved through the hard work of our employees. Branches are intended to serve as a comfortable working base for Musoni staff</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196929\"></a><strong>1.4 Satellite branches</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni also uses satellite offices in addition to full branches. These offices are linked to existing full-scale branches, do not have in-house branch managers<a href=\"http://documents.musoni.co.ke/wp-admin/post.php?post=17&amp;action=edit#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;and are smaller than usual branches. If they attract sufficient customers, they might be upgraded to full-scale branches in due time:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Satellite Office will be opened in area with a minimum of 400 Total Funded Borrowers, enough to support 2 group WCO&rsquo;s. The management will also decide on opening Satellite offices in new market areas to spur growth and support the main branches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Staffing of satellite offices will be as follows;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Senior Wealth Creation Officer in charge of the office.</li>\r\n	<li>2 Wealth Creation Officers in charge of group lending.</li>\r\n	<li>1 Individual loans officer (Entry of this I.L.O to be determined by level of business).</li>\r\n	<li>1 Customer service Advisor.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Satellite Offices shall be equipped with enough cabinets that allow in-house filing, enough working stations (Laptop for SWCO and 3 Desktop computers for CSA, Group WCO&rsquo;s and Individual Loans Officer. Other offices equipment&rsquo;s necessary for conducive working environment will be provided in line with branch set up.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The layout of satellite office will be simple, open layout with one enclosed office cubicle for the SWCO. Partitioning will be in line with Branch standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Upgrading of satellite office to branch status.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A satellite office will be upgraded to a full branch upon attaining the below parameters;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Outstanding loan book of Kshs 40.0 million.</li>\r\n	<li>Total Funded Borrowers of 1,200 (Average caseload of 300 for 4 WCO&rsquo;s).</li>\r\n	<li>Maintain a Portfolio at Risk of below 5% over a period of 6 months.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The responsibilities for the SWCO in charge of satellite office are defined in the lending manual.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc149196930\"></a>2. Determining new branch areas</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196931\"></a>2.1 Introduction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Deciding upon suitable branch areas is a two-stage process:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Feasibility study of a prospective area (described in this chapter)</li>\r\n	<li>Selection of a suitable branch (see chapter 3 below)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196932\"></a>2.2 Prospective area feasibility study</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Prospective operational areas are analysed to determine their suitability for opening a branch. Annex 1 gives the feasibility study format, it focuses upon:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Market potential: significant presence of micro entrepreneurs in the age bracket of 18-70 (specifically between 21-35 of age), who are looking for micro loans with the potential to grow.<a href=\"http://documents.musoni.co.ke/wp-admin/post.php?post=17&amp;action=edit#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;We have a goal of 4,500 clients per branch, with 30,000 potential clients in a specific area this would translate into a 15% marketshare.</li>\r\n	<li>Relevant hinterland: that can be served from this branch</li>\r\n	<li>Competitor presence: while competitor presence does not block opening a branch, it is initially preferable that Musoni operates in areas with limited competitor presence</li>\r\n	<li>Mobile network coverage: in particular by those MNOs with viable MMT programmes</li>\r\n	<li>MMT agent presence: in order for clients to deal with mobile money</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196933\"></a>2.3 Feasibility study</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The feasibility study uses the following analytical techniques:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Desk-top research: to get data about market size and main economic activities in the area</li>\r\n	<li>Observation:&nbsp;general assessment of the activities in the area through direct observations</li>\r\n	<li>Field level interviews:&nbsp;speaking to inhabitants and business owners of the area to get a feel for the community, focusing on issues such as the business challenges they face, their day-to-day cash flows and their financial services needs</li>\r\n	<li>General level interviews:&nbsp;meeting with people who know the area well, such as area chiefs, district officers, community leaders and managers of other financial institutions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196934\"></a>2.4 Deciding on new branch areas</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Musoni Kenya board on recommendation by management is responsible for the approval of a new branch location. The management recommendation will include among other the branch locator report (In order to ensure that Musoni only moves into high potential locations, feasibility studies must be carried out in a minimum of three different areas, one of which shall then be selected for the next branch (if the key criteria are met)), market research findings, projections/budget and break even analysis of the new branch. Management have to liaise with Musoni IT team to ensure system new branch is set up within the IT platform after board approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc149196935\"></a></h1>\r\n\r\n<h1>3. Guidelines for building selection</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196936\"></a>3.1 Background</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once a suitable market has been decided upon, the business development team is responsible for selecting a suitable building to converse into a Musoni branch. In principle Musoni rents its premises, in exceptional cases Musoni could also buy its offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196937\"></a>3.2 Building selection criteria</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is understood that in many branch locations the branch options are limited. Our key branch selection criteria are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Respectable building: in the eyes of our customers the building should be smart, with an attractive exterior without being beyond the reach of our clientele</li>\r\n	<li>Reasonable quality construction</li>\r\n	<li>Respectable surrounding area: for instance, the branch should not be surrounded by drinking dens</li>\r\n	<li>Good transport links: both for clients and employees</li>\r\n	<li>Heavy footfall: ideally a branch should be located on or close to one of the main streets</li>\r\n	<li>Good visibility: the branch should be easily visible from surrounding streets</li>\r\n	<li>Affordable: depending on the location and the quality of the building, Musoni would like to pay between Ksh 25,000 and 75,000 per month, including service charge</li>\r\n	<li>Ground floor: ground floor locations are preferable. Ultimately the branch should be visible and accessible</li>\r\n	<li>Size: depending on the branch location and intended catchment area, a branch should typically be between 1,000 and 1,500 square feet</li>\r\n	<li>Reliable supplies: of electricity, internet and water</li>\r\n	<li>Safe: the branch should be safe for clients and employees</li>\r\n	<li>Contract: there should not be unrealistic demands from the building owner in the contract</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For each prospective building, the Business Development Team puts together a report, broken down into the above sections, including pictures of the building and surrounding area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196938\"></a>3.3 Decision on branch building</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The responsibility of deciding which building shall be used as a branch lies with the Musoni Kenya CEO. It is preferable that he is presented with at least three alternative buildings for each branch location, although it is understood that this is difficult in some areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc149196939\"></a>4. Branch interior design</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the building and location have been selected, work can commence on the interior design of the branch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196940\"></a>4.1 Branch lay-out</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, the exact branch layout depends on each building. There are a number of key working spaces that are required. Please see below for an example of how a Musoni branch might be partitioned, followed by a description of each of the key areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196941\"></a>4.2 Reception area</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon entering a branch, clients are greeted by a receptionist. This area should contain seating for at least six clients. The purpose of the reception area is to provide a comfortable place for clients to wait, before being met by either their branch manager or WCO. The reception area should be clearly branded with Musoni posters and banners (see Manual 13: Marketing).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Example of a branch reception area:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196942\"></a>4.3 WCO working area</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond the reception area, should be the working space of the WCOs. This room should be light and open and each WCO should have enough space to carry out his work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196943\"></a>4.4 Branch Manager&rsquo;s office</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Branch Manager should have an office separate from the WCOs for reasons of privacy. It should provide enough room for the branch manager to carry out day-to-day work, including receiving several people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196944\"></a>4.5 Kitchenette</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni values its staff and as such all Musoni branches should contain a small kitchenette where Musoni staff can make a cup of tea and store their lunch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196945\"></a>4.6 Toilets</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All Musoni branches should contain a single toilet, available to staff, but not to customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196946\"></a>4.7 Meeting room</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Each Musoni branch should contain a small meeting room where WCOs can hold confidential meetings with clients and where the branch credit committee can meet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196947\"></a>4.8 Data Entry Officer working area</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The data entry officer should preferably have a separate place to conduct his work. This area should be close to both the WCO working area and the Branch Manager&rsquo;s Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc149196948\"></a>5.

Clients should be able to tell that a particular building serves as a Musoni branch. All branches should have a similar look and feel in order to strengthen our group identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196950\"></a>5.2 Exterior</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The exterior of all Musoni branches should be similar. There should be a large Musoni plaque above the main entrance, displaying the Musoni logo. The entrance to each Musoni branch should be made of glass, adding to a welcoming feel. The exterior of the building and immediate surrounding area should be kept clean. Clients walking past should be aware of Musoni&rsquo;s presence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Example of a Musoni branch exterior:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc149196951\"></a>5.3 Interior</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior of Musoni branches should be welcoming, light, open and clean. For this it is useful to have some plants in each branch. It is important that clients should immediately feel that they are in a bank branch aimed at successful micro entrepreneurs. However, this should not translate into an elitist image as we are aiming at the starting end of the economic pyramid. Branch interiors should be clearly branded with Musoni posters and banners. At the entrance there should always be a clearly visible list of Musoni&rsquo;s products and prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc149196952\"></a>6.

the branches are geographically spread and operate independently which is normal for the institution of our type. It is therefore important that management provides a clear vision, leadership and a commitment to resources to ensure recovery and continuity of operations for each branch and head office. Successful future recovery efforts will depend on planning and coordination activities that must take place well in advance of actual disaster situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main objective of the business impact assessment is to:-</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Identify the critical business functions/departments, business unit processes and the estimated Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for each.</li>\r\n	<li>Estimate the financial, customer/operational and or legal / regulatory impacts in case a department/business unit fails to operate, assuming a worst case scenario.</li>\r\n	<li>Determine the estimated number of personnel required for recovery operations.</li>\r\n	<li>Provide a foundation for implementing Business Resumption, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plans.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc424923268\"></a><a name=\"_Toc403753610\"></a>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scope</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Business Impact Analysis (BIA) attempts to cover all the business units of Musoni Kenya Ltd i.e. Operations, Credit Administration, Finance&amp; Administration, IT, Internal Audit, Risk and Human Resources.

Internal Audit department&rsquo;s work is heavily reliant on the availability of computers, LANs, WAN, email and other communication facilities. Any failure of any of these facilities will render employees unable to work.</li>\r\n	<li>Operations and Credit Administration departments heavily depend on the availability of the MIS. System failure even for a few hours negatively affects loan processing, resulting into loss of revenue.</li>\r\n	<li>Recovery of information that is not backed up is a challenge across all departments and branches.</li>\r\n	<li>Reporting requirements across board (Finance, Operations, Credit Risk and Internal Audit et al) would be impossible if client data on loans and savings isn&rsquo;t accessible. It is also impossible to recover this information unless it is backed up in the computer system.</li>\r\n	<li>E-mail is a central part of the company&rsquo;s communication system, both internally and externally. Losing old emails would deprive the company of vital information and contacts and therefore expect access to all emails after an incident; minor or major.</li>\r\n	<li>Processing of backlogs varies from department to department for every working day lost Credit Admin and Operations would take 4 hours for each day lost, while Finance and Administration would take up to 2 hours. Recovery Human Resources, Risk and Internal Audit will be easier. IT ICT would need up to 12 &ndash; 36 hours to recover from a disaster in case re-installation of PCs &amp; servers is involved.</li>\r\n	<li>Operations and Credit departments require a list of customers, loan and savings balances in the first 24 hours of an incident/ disaster. These are needed so that resources can support critical customer needs.<a name=\"_Toc403753619\"></a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc424923277\"></a>2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni Kenya Ltd&rsquo;s business is heavily dependent on the functioning of the MIS, including the core operating system (Web Portal), the reporting system (Jasper), the Wide Area Network (WAN) and internal telephone system. The MIS database is hosted by the system vendor in Netherlands. For proper functioning, the disaster recovery and business continuity planning efforts should put emphasis on the infrastructure that supports the Server Rooms, LANs, WAN<a name=\"_Toc403753620\"></a>, the Web Portal and Jasper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, most departments have critical reports and records that are maintained in hard and soft copies.

This is because the inverter has no lag time in taking over as the main power supply if mains electrical power is lost. However lack of UPS does mean that if the inverter fails all computers will power off immediately. The only exception is the server which will always have a UPS installed. This will allow for proper shutdown of the server and hopefully prevent any loss of data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inverters installed at the branches will all be under warranty and should be regularly cleaned to ensure they remain in good working order.

It is a process through which the stakeholders fulfil the Institution&rsquo;s corporate mission and protect the institution&rsquo;s assets over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corporate governance, is defined as the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutional behaviours affecting the way a corporation is directed, administered or controlled. It provides the checks and balances through which the owners and other stakeholders set the standards of objectives and accountability. Corporate governance includes the relationships among the many stakeholders involved and the goals for which the institution is governed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The principal players are the shareholders, the board of directors and management as well as other stakeholders who include employees, customers, lenders, regulators, suppliers, the environment and the community at large</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key objectives of designing the corporate governance structure is to warrant the highest degree of transparency and accountability at all levels and to ensure that all officers act in conformity with the objectives of the business and its shareholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corporate Governance evolves over time in response to changes in the legal structure, complexity and sophistication of the organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corporate Governance is a process defined by the BoD of the Institution. The Board of Director is aware and agrees on the mechanisms used in order to provide effective governance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governance structure is designed to incorporate a clear distinction between the various bodies of the Institution, specifically the BoD and the MT. The BoD defines the Institution&rsquo;s commercial policies and the supervision of the institution (&acute;decision controlling&acute;).

It monitors the Institution&rsquo;s compliance with its MEMARTS, internal policies and procedures as well as pertinent government rules and regulations including statutory and regulatory requirements laid down by the Central Bank of Kenya</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425263167\"></a><a name=\"_Toc301210502\"></a>4.3&nbsp; Strategic Direction</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The board ensures that the Institution&rsquo;s mission is well defined, reviewed periodically and respected. A crucial responsibility, therefore, is to ensure that the institution has a formal mission statement that clarifies the institution&rsquo;s main purpose of being. It provides institution direction that is conducive to the fulfilment of the mission. In recognising that the mission may change and evolve over time, the BoD will review the mission periodically and make changes in response to a changing environment and amended priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BoD ensures effective planning. The MT assumes responsibility for preparing strategic, business and other action plans, the BoD oversees the process, provides guidance and input into three areas: i) Charting the institutions strategic course, ii) Setting broad operational policies, iii) Resolving strategic issues as they arise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The board works to enhance the image of the institution and plays an important part in shaping the institutions image, prestige and credibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425263168\"></a><a name=\"_Toc301210503\"></a>4.4&nbsp; Fiduciary</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The Board serves as the institutions steward. It is the ultimate repository of the power and property invested in the institution by third parties. The BoD is entrusted to protect their property and ensure that it is managed in a manner that is consistent with agreed values and goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BoD should also ensure that the institution has adequate resources to implement the agreed plans. There are two components to this responsibility:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Understanding the institution&rsquo;s short and long term financial position in relation to its strategic plan, and</li>\r\n	<li>Taking necessary actions to secure the necessary resources in order to implement that plan</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition the BoD balances the short term pressures on financial performance with an awareness and understanding of what is needed to guarantee the institutions long term viability</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425263169\"></a><a name=\"_Toc301210504\"></a>4.5&nbsp; Oversight</h1>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>The BoD governs, but does not manage the institution.

The MT assumes operational authority and ensures implementation of the institution&rsquo;s program of activities as agreed upon with the BoD.</li>\r\n	<li>The BoD appoints and oversees the performance of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Institution and of the other members of the MT. The BoD appraises the performance of the MT.</li>\r\n	<li>The BoD monitors operational and business performance and in order to ensure that the Institution uses its resources effectively the board monitors the performance of the portfolio, operations and financial indicators. It does this through frequent and transparent reports, regular board meetings, internal and external audit reports and any other instruments.</li>\r\n	<li>The BoD evaluates the institutions performance against its peer institutions, both locally and globally.</li>\r\n	<li>The BoD assesses and responds to internal and external risks and establishes early warning systems and ensures that the Institution operates prudently in the face of these challenges.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425263170\"></a><a name=\"_Toc301210505\"></a>4.6&nbsp; Self Assessment</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The BoD shall regularly assess its own performance.

Whilst Branch Managers report directly to the Chief Operating Officer (COO), it is essential to recognise that the CEO will provide direction across the whole Institution and that Branch Managers mirror the CEO&rsquo;s role in their own branches.</li>\r\n	<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Chief Operating Officer (COO)</strong>&nbsp;carries MT-level responsibility for all operations including both the loan portfolio and the deposit portfolio (one the deposit taking licence is issued) all credit and non-credit products and services across the whole of the network. Consequently the COO manages and supervises all Branch Managers and all Wealth Creation Officers throughout the Institution. The responsibilities, cover both the Front and Middle Office so that the COO will be equally responsible for quantity and quality of the portfolios and will consequently chair the Head Office Credit Committee and delegate authority to Branch Credit Committees.</li>\r\n	<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Chief Financial Officer (CFO)&nbsp;</strong>carries MT level responsibility for the company&rsquo;s finance, accountancy premises and infrastructure, logistics, administration and other corporate functions, which include budgeting and planning, fiscal policies and procedures, financial systems and internal controls. Within the organization, the CFO carries responsibility for the whole of the Back Office and support functions including all Bank accounts and cash operations of the Institution. The CFO is the Principal Point of Contact (PPOC) with the Central Bank on all Regulatory and Reporting issues and for obtaining the necessary approvals for the Institution to do business.</li>\r\n	<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO)&nbsp;</strong>is responsible for all HR matters across the institution supporting and facilitating the recruitment, development and retention of qualified and motivated staff; institutionalization and implementation of the Musoni Performance Management system; and all matters relating to the HR Policies and Procedures;.</li>\r\n	<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Risk Manager (RM)&nbsp;</strong>is responsible for managing risks to the organization, its employees, customers, reputation, assets and interests of stakeholders in a variety of sectors including enterprise risk, corporate governance, regulatory, operational, business continuity, information and security, technology, market and credit risk. The RM will identify and assess threats, put in place plans for mitigation and decide how to avoid, reduce or transfer risks.</li>\r\n	<li>The&nbsp;<strong>IT Manager (ITM)&nbsp;</strong>is responsible for deployment, monitoring, maintenance, development, upgrade, and support of all IT systems of the institution including but not limited to the Musoni System, Emails, Website, operatings systems, software applications, databases and IT peripherals.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425263188\"></a><a name=\"_Toc301210522\"></a><a name=\"_Toc425263187\"></a>6.2&nbsp; MT Meetings and Items for discussion</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Management meetings will be held at least monthly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No formal record of the verbatim discussions will be taken but an Issue Log prepared of Issues discussed and a note of decisions taken together with Agreed Action Points (including who is handling the matter and when the task is to be completed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When appropriate and for particular items on the Agenda, members of MT are free to invite other Staff from their Departments as observers and advisors but with no voting rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Head of Internal Auditor &nbsp;and the Risk Manager are invited as a non-voting attendees to provide technical advice and counsel.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a name=\"_Toc301210523\"></a><a name=\"_Toc239403918\"></a><a name=\"_Toc239415940\"></a><a name=\"_Toc239436180\"></a><a name=\"_Toc239403919\"></a><a name=\"_Toc239415941\"></a><a name=\"_Toc239436181\"></a>&nbsp;<strong>Department independent of the Management Team</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425263189\"></a>Within the Institution there is one Department that is wholly independent of the MT and which derives its authority directly from a committee of the Board of Directors:</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Internal Audit Department</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internal Audit Department is an independent review function set up within the Institution as a service to the BoD including all Board Sub Committees and all levels of management.

Thus, in an effort to improve risk management practices of Musoni, BoD has adopted this Risk Management Manual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This manual aims to facilitate the anchoring of the risk management function of Musoni in a control environment of three lines of defense. It defines the risk management philosophy and risk appetite directly on the basis of Musoni&#39;s mission statement and reiterates the commitment of Musoni to contribute to the development of its target clientele through the provision of microfinance services in Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Risk Management Manual provides guidance on the risk management process of Musoni, including the identification, measurement, monitoring, control, mitigation and reporting of risk exposures. It also defines the powers and responsibilities of the structures and stakeholders within the organization involved in the risk management process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Risk Management Manual establishes the general framework of risk management at Musoni. It provides the common roof on which the elementary risk management policies of Musoni will be based. The elementary risk management policies will cover in detail the specific risk limits and authorized instruments for the mitigation of risks in each category.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425253675\"></a><a name=\"_Toc144007114\"></a><strong>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Purpose</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of this manual is to document the principles and processes of the Risk Management Framework as they are applied at Musoni.

Musoni applies the best practice concept of &ldquo;Three Lines of Defense&rdquo; for its risk management framework. A strong risk culture combined with a sharp focus on three effective lines of defense, front office, risk management function, and internal audit are the key to Musoni&rsquo;s successful risk management. The three lines of defense are staffed with capable individuals with a strong sense of proper risk management and the desire to continuously improve the approach to manage risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425253677\"></a><strong>1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Risk Management Philosophy</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni believes that effective management involves accepting a certain level of residual risk. Musoni does not seek to prevent or eliminate any risk exposure at all costs. This risk manual and its elementary components will help Musoni make informed decisions on the treatment of risks. Management may well choose to accept, diversify, mitigate or transfer identified risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425253678\"></a><strong>1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Risk Appetite</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni is an active risk taker in the area of credit risk, but attempts to minimize the exposure to other risks. As an active risk taker, the overall risk appetite of Musoni is &ldquo;<strong>low</strong><strong>&nbsp;to moderate&rdquo;</strong>. Musoni believes that maintaining strict limits in relation to risk exposures is the most appropriate approach to ensure the sustainable provision of financial services to low-income populations in Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, Musoni will neither invest in a financial instrument, nor raise funds nor engage in a financial activity unless it is consistent with its mission to grow, build and maximize the potential of the businesses of the poor and unbanked of Kenya through the provision of affordable, flexible and customer-orientated financial services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The risk appetite as defined in this manual will guide Musoni&rsquo;s strategy and the decision to launch new products and enter new markets. In the elementary policies, the risk appetite will be translated into appropriate exposure limits for each risk dimension.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425253679\"></a><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Structure</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Governance Structure Manual defines the governance structure of Musoni and prepares the basis for the Risk Management Framework.

The RMU is headed by Musoni&rsquo;s Risk Manager who is responsible for the execution of the activities of the RMU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RMU constitute the independent risk management function that operates on the second line of defense in Musoni&rsquo;s Risk Management Framework. RMU Staff take the role as internal consultants for risk management, responsible for supporting the operational units in the identification, measurement and management of risks that may arise in the course of doing business at Musoni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Responsibilities of the RMU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The responsibilities of the RMU are listed in the following.

The responsibilities include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Quantitative and qualitative assessment on a regular and ongoing basis of risks to which Musoni is exposed.</li>\r\n	<li>Development and maintenance of a system of internal limits that are more granular than the high-level organizational risk limits set and approved by the BoD/RMC. This is particularly relevant at the credit risk level and should allow for a fine tuning of efforts to monitor key risks and ultimately influence effective portfolio management. The Risk Manager may monitor this separately or else suggest formalizing this granular limit structure (and any changes therein) to the ALCO and seek approval as needed on an ongoing basis.</li>\r\n	<li>Monitoring of Musoni&rsquo;s risk profile, particularly that risk remains at levels deemed acceptable by ALCO, through reporting of trends and fluctuations (particularly if acceptable limits are bypassed or new, unacceptable risks are taken). For that task, the Risk Manager shall rely on the support from IT, Finance, Operations, HR, Internal Audit, and other relevant departments. The respective departments are required to provide support to the Risk Manager.</li>\r\n	<li>Periodically develops and presents reports on different risk aspects at Musoni, laid out in the detail sections on each risk.</li>\r\n	<li>Supports the implementation of IT solutions for risk management.</li>\r\n	<li>Management of Musoni&rsquo;s Credit Risk in line with the descriptions in the Lending and Credit Manual</li>\r\n	<li>Management of Musoni&rsquo;s Operational Risk in line with the descriptions in the various additional policies that cover Operational risk.</li>\r\n	<li>Management of Musoni&rsquo;s Liquidity and Market Risk in line with the various additional policies that cover Liquidity referenced in that chapter with the support of the respective departments.</li>\r\n	<li>Management of Musoni&rsquo;s Other Risks in line with the descriptions in the Chapter &ldquo;Special Tasks and Situations&rdquo; and with the support of the respective departments.</li>\r\n	<li>Examining new product proposals and making appropriate recommendations to Management Team when considering approvals of such new products. This examination is done in coordination with the Internal Auditor.</li>\r\n	<li>Monitoring of other risks as appropriate, including assessing fundamental risk factors including Early Warning Indicators.</li>\r\n	<li>Maintain a business relationship with the local regulators and be the first contact point for questions related to Risk Management from the Regulator.</li>\r\n	<li>Preparation of the RMC. This includes the preparation of the reporting package, collecting the agenda items and preparation of proposals.</li>\r\n	<li>Tracking of decisions by the RMC through minutes and support to the RMC in the communication of the RMC decisions within the organization as appropriate.</li>\r\n	<li>Preparation of the ALCO. This includes the preparation of the reporting package, collecting the agenda items and preparation of proposals.</li>\r\n	<li>Tracking of decisions by the ALCO through minutes, communication of the ALCO decisions within the organization as appropriate.</li>\r\n	<li>Coordination with the Internal Audit Department to ensure that Internal Audit is in the position to control compliance with established internal risk policy and structures.</li>\r\n	<li>Regular review of policies and guidelines and elaboration of suggestions for improvements</li>\r\n	<li>Regular review processes and elaboration of suggestions for improvements.</li>\r\n	<li>Developing mechanisms and strategies designed to improve the overall risk culture within Musoni, including appropriate training and support.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RMU Structure and Resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To properly fulfill its responsibilities, the Risk Management Unit will have adequate human and technical resources for optimizing existing methods and introducing new techniques for identifying and quantifying risks to which Musoni is exposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Risk Manager can suggest to the ALCO or if necessary to the RMC the staffing plan of the RMU and request the required human resources. Under certain circumstances and for special projects, RMU could seek temporary project based resources from other departments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Independence of RMU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through this manual, Musoni establishes the principle of independence of the Risk Management Unit. This independence means that RMU staff will in no case be involved in operational tasks; they will never be subordinated to the business units that they are supposed to control and their compensation schemes will not include commercial risk-taking targets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425253685\"></a><strong>2.2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Individual Staff Members</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This manual establishes that all staff members of Musoni are an integral part of the Risk Management Framework and will be held accountable for individual risks. They are responsible to continuously improve the approach to Risk Management. While Musoni&rsquo;s Risk Unit is in place to manage the risks of the organization, it is the responsibility of each staff member to act responsibly and not enter risk in inappropriate ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Toc144007115\"></a>Musoni promotes the understanding among all the staff that Risk Management and risk awareness are a key part of Musoni&rsquo;s risk culture. Every staff member is requested to report systematically and promptly to their managers and the Risk Manager via the provided tools (Risk self-Assessment, incident reporting) or if necessary through direct communication, any perceived new risks or failures of existing control measures. Musoni will undertake what measures it deems appropriate to promote and reward such efforts by its staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425253686\"></a><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Special Tasks of the RMU</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425253687\"></a><strong>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Risk Matrix</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni uses a risk matrix that is based on industry best practice, adjusted for the specific needs of the institution. The Risk Matrix covers the risk categories governance, external risks, operational risk, IT risk, credit risk, and market risk. In each of these categories, several criteria are pre-defined and space is provided to define additional criteria. In the risk matrix, classifications are in three levels (low, medium, and high). Using initial severity and impact, and assessing the existing control mechanisms, a risk gap can be derived. This risk gap reflects the remaining open risk in that specific criteria. Based on assessment of Musoni&rsquo;s Risk Manager, this gap can be classified between 1 (low) and 5 (high).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next steps involves classification of all criteria by the rating of the gap. From that step an action plan for improvements to the risk management process for the next 12 months is derived. The specific activities of the action plan depend on the nature of the gap. This can range from updating policies to implementing additional checks or tool at just the criteria for internal audit to review processes and procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is recommended to update the risk matrix on an annual basis to check the progress made with regards to mitigating the most important risk gaps and to analyze whether additional risk criteria have to be considered in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc425253688\"></a><strong>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Risk Management Activity Plan</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Risk Manager will complete an annual Activity Plan which includes all the tasks and special assignments related to Risk Management aside from the regular routine tasks as mentioned in the policies and manuals. The Activity Plan is largely based on the findings of the Risk Matrix with additional input from the Management Team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Risk Manager is responsible for the execution of the Activity Plan but can suggest a delegation of responsibilities where appropriate. In addition, the Risk Manager can also request additional resources in the execution of the activity plan</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Activity Plan is reviewed and approved by the Risk Management Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://documents.musoni.co.ke/wp-admin/post.php?post=23&amp;action=edit#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;See Governance Structure Manual Section 8.1: The Members of the ALCO include the members of the MT as voting members, with the CEO as the Chairman of the ALCO.

INTRODUCTION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This manual provides the General terms and conditions of employment for staff members of Musoni Kenya Limited and shall apply to all staff. This Manual outlines policy to be followed in the management of staff matters. It is freely accessible for Musoni employees and relevant stakeholders. All conditions have been made in good faith and are subject to prevailing laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.1. Musoni Kenya limited</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni Kenya Limited was born out of a desire to improve both the quality and accessibility of financial services available to poor and unbanked Kenyans. It was incorporated by Musoni BV, based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Musoni BV is a service company, a management company, a repository of knowledge and expertise on starting and running MFIs, and a holding company of stakes in MFIs. Musoni Kenya Limited is the first microfinance institution to be established by Musoni BV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 2012 Musoni BV welcomed three strategic partners with KfW, Grameen Foundation, and Access Africa Fund becoming new shareholders in the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.2. Vision<br />\r\nTo be the most efficient microfinance institution in Kenya by being cashless, paperless and data-driven to offer the best value, most flexible and most customer-oriented financial services in the market.<br />\r\n1.3. Mission</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To grow, build and maximize the potential of the businesses of the low income and unbanked of Kenya through the provision of affordable, flexible and customer-oriented financial services.<br />\r\n1.4. Core values<br />\r\nWe pursue long-term relations with Musoni Kenya clients, employees and stakeholders. Musoni<br />\r\nKenya core values are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation: Develop new ideas to enable us to be the most efficient microfinance institution in Kenya, delivering innovative and competitive financial services by using the latest technology and data analytics.<br />\r\nIntegrity: Do what is right, treat clients, partners and each other with utmost respect, honesty and uphold the highest ethical standards.<br />\r\nCustomer Focus: Delivering process oriented and Quality driven services aligned with our customer needs.<br />\r\nExcellence: Strive to deliver first class service through best talent and continuous personal and professional development aiming to create value to our staff, clients and shareholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. GENERAL PRINCIPLES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.1. Equal opportunity:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni Kenya Limited is an equal opportunity employer. Therefore, Musoni shall apply objective and fair criteria to ensure that staff members are selected, assessed, promoted and treated on the basis of their merits, abilities and experience relevant to their post. No suitable job applicant or staff member shall receive less favourable treatment than others in similar circumstances on grounds of personal characteristics, such as race, colour, national, social or ethnic origin and language, gender, marital status, disability, class, age, political or religious belief or HIV status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final criterion for appointment and promotion is merit. The principle of equal opportunity shall form the fundamental framework for human resource development. Musoni Kenya Limited shall pay male and female employees equal remuneration for work of equal value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.2. Open-Door Policy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In keeping with the company&rsquo;s philosophy of open communication, all employees have the right and are encouraged to speak freely with management about their job-related concerns. We urge you to go directly to your supervisor to discuss your job-related ideas, recommendations, concerns and other issues which are important to you. If after talking with your supervisor, you feel the need for additional discussion, you are encouraged to speak with the Chief Executive Officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important relationship you will develop at the Company will be between you and your supervisor. However, should you need support from someone other than your supervisor, the entire management team, including the CEO, is committed to resolving your individual concerns in a timely and appropriate manner (see Annex I: Organogram).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.3 Whistle Blowing Policy<br />\r\nMusoni is committed to high standards of ethical, moral and legal business conduct. In line with this commitment, and the Board and the management is committed to open communication. This policy aims to provide an avenue for Musoni employees to raise concerns and reassurance that they will be protected from reprisals or victimization for whistleblowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whistleblowing policies are generally intended to make it easier for members of staff to be able to report irregularities in good faith, without having to fear that their action may have adverse consequences.<br />\r\nThe Whistleblowing Policy is a key element for safeguarding the Musoni&rsquo;s integrity. It is aimed at enhancing transparency and underpinning its system for combating practices that might damage its activities and reputation.<br />\r\nProtecting the integrity and reputation of MUSONI requires the active support of all members of MUSONI&rsquo;s staff, who are required to report incidents of suspected fraud, corruption, collusion and coercion, and other serious infringements of the rules and policies in force at MUSONI. Members of staff must also cooperate in investigations into such incidents.<br />\r\nBy creating an environment of trust and maximum protection for the members of its staff, MUSONI wants to encourage them to cooperate in full. It is putting in place arrangements that will ensure that members of staff who report irregularities in good faith are afforded the utmost confidentiality and greatest degree of and most effective protection possible against any retaliation or reprisals, whether actual or threatened, as a result of their whistleblowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Basic whistleblowing principles<br />\r\nThe basic principles of MUSONI&rsquo;s Whistleblowing Policy are as follows:<br />\r\nthe persons concerned must have a choice between a number of channels for whistleblowing and communication; in certain circumstances, they must be able to bypass the main channels for whistleblowing if these prove inappropriate;<br />\r\nmembers of staff must not under any circumstances be subject to reprisals for whistleblowing;<br />\r\nmembers of staff who report incidents in good faith must be protected and their identity must insofar as possible remain confidential;<br />\r\nthe reported incidents shall be verified in the appropriate manner and, if they are confirmed, MUSONI shall take all necessary steps to identify appropriate remedies;<br />\r\nthe basic rights of any person implicated by the reported incidents must be respected, whilst ensuring that the procedures provided for are effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Scope of the policy<br />\r\nMUSONI&rsquo;s Whistleblowing Policy applies to all permanent staff members and any other person providing MUSONI with services, including consultants and other service providers under contract (grouped together for the purposes of this document under the term &ldquo;staff member(s)&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Reporting Obligations<br />\r\nMembers of staff are required to report any suspected or presumed incidents of illegal behaviour in the activities of MUSONI or of serious misconduct or serious infringement of MUSONI&rsquo;s rules, policies or guidelines, or any action that is or could be harmful to the mission or reputation of MUSONI (hereinafter &ldquo;irregularities&rdquo;).<br />\r\nSuch incidents may involve members of staff, borrowers, promoters, contractors, suppliers, beneficiaries or any other persons or entities.

Reporting arrangements and anonymity</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is up to staff members to choose the most appropriate channel for reporting incidents which they must disclose. However, if a matter is reported to an authority that is not competent to deal with it, it is up to that authority to transmit, in strictest confidence, the relevant information and documents to the competent authority and to inform the member of staff accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>f. Maintaining confidentiality<br />\r\nThe confidentiality and anonymity of persons making complaints or expressing concerns will be maintained to the fullest extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an investigation unless required by law to break that confidentiality. The Board encourages you to supply contact information with your submission to facilitate clarification and any assistance with possible investigation.<br />\r\nTo assist the Board in reviewing and, if necessary, investigating your complaints or concerns, you should provide as much factual, rather than speculative, information as possible. To the extent possible, you should include the following information in your submission:<br />\r\nthe alleged event, matter or issue that is the subject of the complaint or concern;<br />\r\nthe name of each person you believe involved;<br />\r\nif the complaint or concern involves a specific event or events, the approximate date(s) and location(s) of each event; and<br />\r\nany additional information, documentation or other evidence you believe support the complaint or concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>g. Protection of the whistleblower<br />\r\nAny staff member who reports an irregularity, provided that this is done in good faith and in compliance with the provisions of this policy, shall be protected against any acts of retaliation.<br />\r\nFor the purposes of this policy, &quot;retaliation&quot; is defined as any action or threat of action which is unjustly detrimental to the whistleblower because of his/her report, including, but not limited to, harassment, discrimination and acts of vindictiveness, direct or indirect, that are recommended, threatened or taken against the whistleblower.<br />\r\n&ldquo;Good faith&rdquo; can be taken to mean the unequivocal belief in the veracity of the reported incidents, i.e. the fact that the member of staff reasonably believes the transmitted information to be true.<br />\r\nStaff members, who make a report in bad faith, particularly if it is based knowingly on false or misleading information, shall not be protected and shall be subject to disciplinary measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>h. Protective Measures<br />\r\nThe protection of a person reporting an irregularity shall be guaranteed first of all by the fact that their identity will be treated in confidence. This means that their name will not be revealed, unless the whistle-blower personally authorises the disclosure of his/her identity or this is a statutory requirement, particularly if it is essential to ensure that the right of the persons implicated to be given a fair hearing is upheld. In such a case, person handling the report (one of the three persons mentioned above) shall be required to notify the whistleblower before revealing their identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. No Retaliation<br />\r\nNo member of staff who in good faith reports irregularity shall suffer harassment, retaliation or adverse employment consequence. Where members of staff consider that they have been the victim of retaliation for reporting an irregularity or have good reason to believe or fear that they are exposed to a risk of retaliation as a result of their reporting an irregularity, they shall be entitled to complain to the any other person mentioned above and request that protective measures be adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authority approached shall assess the circumstances of the case referred to it and may recommend to the BOD that temporary and/or permanent measures that are necessary in the interests of MUSONI be adopted with a view to protecting the staff member in question. The staff member shall be informed in writing of the results of this procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>j. Training of staff on whistleblowing<br />\r\nAll Musoni staff will be trained on the whistleblowing at all levels of the organization in relation to whistleblowing law and the organization&rsquo;s policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>k. Handling reported violations<br />\r\nAll reports will be promptly investigated and treated consistently and fairly within 60 days from the day of reporting. Appropriate corrective action will be taken if warranted by the investigation. The complainant will be informed that follow-up has or is occurring within two weeks after the Executive Director or board officer has received the complaint or report. The Executive Committee shall be informed of all such complaints or reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>l. Penalties for those taking retaliatory actions<br />\r\nAny form of retaliation undertaken by a staff member against any person for reporting an irregularity in good faith is prohibited and considered to be a serious breach of the loyalty and professional ethics requirements of MUSONI&rsquo;s Code of Conduct. In such a case disciplinary measures shall be taken.<br />\r\nMembers of staff will be informed of the measures taken by MUSONI following the discovery of acts of retaliation for reporting an incident. The information provided will not contain any data that will enable the people concerned to be identified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>m. Rights of persons implicated<br />\r\nAny staff member implicated by reports of irregularities must be notified in good time of the allegations made against them, provided that this notification does not impede the progress of the procedure for establishing the circumstances of the case. In any event, findings referring to a staff member specifically by name may not be made upon the completion of the above-mentioned procedure, unless that staff member has had the opportunity to put forward their comments in keeping with the principle of respect for the right to be given a fair hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After having heard the implicated staff member, or after having requested the latter to put their case in writing if, for objective reasons, it is not possible to hear them directly, the person handling the report (one of the three persons mentioned above) shall decide on the measures required in MUSONI&rsquo;s interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the reporting of irregularities and/or the ensuing procedure will involve dealing with personal data, such data shall be managed in keeping with the principles and rules provided for in the regulations applicable to MUSONI. Those involved in the reporting procedure and in any related procedure, including whistle-blowers themselves, may contact the GM at any time in order to check that the rights conferred by the relevant provisions have been respected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>n. Annual Reporting<br />\r\nAt the end of each year the Head of Internal Audit shall report on how the organizations reputation has been saved or how it has been saved from making losses by a whistle blower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>o. Modification<br />\r\nThe Audit Committee or the Board of Directors of Musoni Kenya can modify this Policy unilaterally at any time without notice. Modification may be necessary, among other reasons, to maintain compliance with local regulations and/or accommodate organizational changes within the Company.<br />\r\n2.4. Harassment Policy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Company will not tolerate harassment or intimidation of our employees on any basis prohibited by law, including race, colour, sex, age, religion, national origin, or marital status. Moreover, any suggestions made to any employee that sexual favors will affect any term or condition of employment with the Company will not be tolerated. It is the policy of the Company that any harassment, including acts creating a hostile work environment or any other discriminatory acts directed against our employees, will result in discipline, up to and including termination of service. The Company also will not tolerate any such harassment of our employees by our clients or vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For purposes of this policy, Sexual Harassment is any repeated unwanted behavior of a sexual nature perpetrated upon an individual by another&rdquo;. It may be verbal, visual, written or physical and can occur between people of different genders or those of the same sex. The following are examples of conduct that, depending upon the circumstances, may constitute sexual harassment:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unwelcome sexual jokes, language, epithets, advances or propositions;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Written or oral abuse of a sexual nature, sexually degrading or vulgar words to describe an individual;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The display of sexually suggestive objects, pictures, posters or cartoons;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unwelcome comments about an individual&rsquo;s body;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asking questions about sexual conduct;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unwelcome touching, leering, whistling, brushing against the body, or suggestive, insulting or obscene comments or gestures;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demanding sexual favors in exchange for favorable reviews, assignments, promotions, or continued employment, or promises of the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employees must bring any violation of this policy to the immediate attention of their immediate supervisor, CHRO or the CEO. The Company will thoroughly investigate all such claims with due regard for the privacy of the individuals involved. Any employee who knowingly retaliates against an employee who has reported workplace harassment or discrimination shall be subject to immediate<br />\r\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of service.<br />\r\n3.0 RECRUITMENT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This policy is intended to provide assistance to those members of staff involved in the recruitment process within the organisation and specifies the procedures through from advertising to offer of employment. It is also intended to provide advice on best practice to ensure that the company&rsquo;s recruitment process is consistent and effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recruitment in Musoni Kenya Limited shall be targeted at addressing specific needs of the organization. Musoni Kenya shall strive to attract employees of the highest caliber and integrity to ensure the achievement of the organizational goals &amp; objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.1 Recruitment and Selection Process<br />\r\nStep 1: Request to recruit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The head of department shall make a formal request and justify the need to recruit. Details of vacancies and the job specifications/requirements shall be submitted to the CHRO by the Head of Department where new staff is required. Open positions are not automatically approved but must be reviewed before the position is posted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2: CEO Approval and HR feedback</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CHRO shall consult the Chief Finance Officer to advise on whether the vacant position is budgeted for and the approved salary range. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) will be the final person to approve any recruitment of a new staff.<br />\r\nHR will then communicate with the relevant Head of Department upon approval. In case of non-approval, clear reasons will be given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3: Advertising for open position</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Human resources will advertise and attempt to fill staff vacancies by promotion and/or transfer within the organization and, subject to the provision that merit is the final criterion. Preference shall be given to suitably qualified staff members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internal Advertisement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staff members shall be notified of upcoming vacancies through internal advertisement. Qualifications and experience required for the post will be stated in an advertisement, which will be circulated to all staff via email (all@staff.musoni.co.ke). Staff members who wish to be considered for an advertised position should submit an application letter and an updated CV before the closing date indicated in the advertisement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>External Advertisement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case we are not able to source internally, an external advert will either be done through the daily newspaper, directly with recognized middle level colleges or Universities, appointed Head Hunters or referrals. All advertisements for vacancies shall be approved by the CHRO or his/her designate before publication External advertisement.<br />\r\nHead Hunting<br />\r\nHeadhunting is a very specialized area of recruitment of sourcing high profiles without dependency on job adverts and employees seeking employment. It involves hunting candidates through direct contacts or personal meetings in order to convince the candidates to participate in the recruitment process. Musoni Kenya may occasionally engage a Headhunting Firm to find best talent for senior level positions and jobs that require a high degree of expertise. Musoni will provide the headhunter with a detailed job description and work closely together in the interviewing and selection process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 4: Application screening process</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All job applications for any advertised position will come thru the careers@musoni.co.ke email account which acts as the central database for all job applications. During the time of advertising, the applicants will be advised to quote the job title on the subject line as they apply which makes it easy to sort out all the applications that relate to the specific job that we have advertised for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The HR will do the initial screening of the CVs as per the actual Job Description and print out the applications that meet the job specifications. The hard copy file will be shared with the Head of Department and soft copy folder with the Branch Manager. The shortlisting will be done by a panel of 3 people. A summary of all the applicants that have been shortlisted by the panel will be provided to ensure that the panel has an upper hand on the shortlist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Departmental Heads are allowed to access all the applications that have been received from the official recruitment email account careers@musoni.eu and act as a 2nd checkers to the HR. The password for this email account will keep on changing for security reasons and the heads of departments must therefore request for the new password.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 5: Interview process</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior management interview</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A panel of not less than three C-level persons, including the CEO and CHRO, and a Board Member shall conduct an interview for the senior management and Internal Auditor. Branch Managers will also be interviewed by at least 3 members of the Senior Management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For every Management position, the panel should interview at least 8 shortlisted candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other staff interview</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A panel of not less than three people persons, including the Head of Department or his/her designate under which the vacant position falls, shall conduct the interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each panelist shall fill in a score sheet for each candidate who is interviewed indicating the score in each of the different categories being examined. A standard score sheet will be used and it may be varied from time to time to suit the requirements for each job</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Practical Tests</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Practical tests shall be given to candidates depending on the position to evaluate the candidate&rsquo;s practical ability to perform the job. The CHRO and the Head of Department or his/her designate shall be involved in setting the practical test that must be relevant to that particular position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CEO will approve the test and the pass mark. The test will be marked and evaluated by HR or any other independent person appointed by the CHRO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case of recruitment of Fresh Graduates from recognized institutions&rsquo;, the aptitude test will be used to eliminate the many applicants. Graduates that pass the aptitude test will qualify for the oral interview. The aptitude test will be administered by the HR department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Psychometric Tests<br />\r\nMusoni has adopted the Hogan Psychometric tests in the recruitment process to help give a better overall evaluation of candidate and hopefully secure the best fit for the role. The format of tests varies and can either measure single factors or multiple variables. Tests typically consist of knowledge tests, personality questionnaires and accuracy tests. A psychometric test will never be used in isolation but as one component of a wider, integrated evaluation strategy.<br />\r\nStep 6: Selection process</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The selection criteria at Musoni will be based on MERIT i.e. the skills, knowledge and attributes that a candidate has in order to undertake successfully the responsibilities and duties of a position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following criteria will be used by the interviewing panel: -</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. Mandatory levels of qualification, experience and or training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii. Core competencies required to undertake the duties and responsibilities of the job. iii. Possession of good communication skills<br />\r\niv. Ability of the applicant to show that he/she has good computer knowledge or basic arithmetic</p>\r\n\r\n<p>skill for WCO&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final decision on the most suitable candidate for the job will be made by the interview panel based on the selection criteria. The decision on the hiring of C-level staff and the Internal Auditor will be made by the Board of Directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 7: Reference Check/ Background Check<br />\r\nEvery successful candidate (with the exception of Fresh Graduates) will undergo an additional independent background check to ensure that we do not attract candidates that are fraudulent or with bad history and therefore putting Musoni into risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni has an approved independent firm (Hawk eye Technologies) who shall do the following on behalf of Musoni:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Verify highest level of education for authenticity and confirm with the issuing institution.<br />\r\nInvestigate past employment history<br />\r\niii. Verify if the candidate has ever been involved in any criminal activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 8: Appointment of candidate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chief Executive Officer shall exercise the Board of Directors&#39; authority in respect of all non- management staff members&#39; appointments, transfers and promotions. Upon appointment, each staff member shall receive a letter of appointment, which shall include the following provisions: -<br />\r\na) The names and addresses of the parties to the contract of employment;<br />\r\nb) Effective date of continuous service;<br />\r\nc) The title of the job that the employee is employed to do, the nature of the appointment, including reporting lines.

The Chief HR Officer or his/her designate shall obtain an assurance of the permit applicable which allows the staff member (in some cases a visa and work permit are both required) initially to enter the country to take up employment and residence. Musoni Kenya Limited shall assist the staff member to obtain all permits for the staff member and his/her family.

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.1 Performance Appraisal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Performance appraisal is a critical instrument of management toward various decision related to development, retention and effective utilization of available Human Resource, including defining fair rewarding system in return to the excellent performers. Consequently, an effective appraisal system will help us to assess our staff against defined objectives. It gives us the chance to give constructive feedback and to praise staff for their good work, which in turn will make them feel valued. It also offers the opportunity to:<br />\r\nAddress problems related to performance<br />\r\nDiscuss apparent weaknesses<br />\r\nFind possible alternative solutions available in place.<br />\r\nProvides a chance to define further objectives for our employees.<br />\r\nEvery employee must be appraised/evaluated at least twice per year i.e. in January and July of every year. However, employees under probation will be appraised at the end of the probation period which is 6 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to have an effective, efficient and fair appraisal system, it&#39;s useful to set out clear objectives, ideally with quantifiable performance targets, so our staff understands what we expect of them. Defining performance targets to the staff will help in the following;<br />\r\nIt will ensure that every employee&#39;s contribution fits into the overall aims and target of the business<br />\r\nProvide clear and precise direction to both supervisor and employee<br />\r\nIt will help individual employees better understand their aims and role within the business<br />\r\nForm common frame of reference around which the supervisor and the employee can effectively communicate.<br />\r\nIt will Create standards to measure the quantity and quality of employees&#39; work<br />\r\nHelps to monitor the success of the department and its contribution to the business as a whole.<br />\r\nIt also helps to Identify ways to make the Department run more efficiently</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.1.1 How to Set Performance Targets (setting goals)<br />\r\nAt every end of a year the line manager / supervisor should set out at least 5 key performance indicators for individual employees, from which they will be appraised their performance in the subsequent year. However, in order to set out sensible and viable key performance indicators, following issues are very important;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agreeable Goals and Targets<br />\r\nLine manager or supervisor should make sure that employees are well and strongly involved in identifying the performance indicators and agree them. This will help to make the employees feel being part of the decision hence increase their commitment to the goals or targets in hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Targets/ Goals V&rsquo;s Job description<br />\r\nThe Performance indicators or Targets should follow the key areas of performance as shown in the job description and the key aspects of the job. If the goals and targets put in place seem unbearable to the employee, then break goals down into smaller goals, or sub goals / objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goals and Targets Should be &ldquo;SMART&rdquo;<br />\r\nAll set out targets and goals should be SMART, in the following sense;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>S Specific. Avoid being vague. For example, &quot;work harder&quot; does not indicate in what aspects of the job the employee should put more effort in. However, mention of customer relations, numeracy accuracy, processing of applications, team relations etc. are specific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>M Measurable. The expected behaviour and results should be quantifiable. For example improve on customer relations is not measurable. However, &quot;visit three major customers a week&quot; is measurable. Another example is; &quot;reduce departmental costs by 15%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Agreed. Targets and objectives that are not agreed between the manager and employee have little chance of being achieved. Avoid giving easy targets. Avoid giving the same targets to all your staff unless you perceive them to have equal abilities. Agree with the employee based on the business unit objectives and the employee&#39;s current competencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>R Realistic. Both manager and employee should ensure that the set targets are achievable. Consider the employee&#39;s abilities and potential, work environment, motivation levels and anticipated obstacles and availability of important resources to meet the goals agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>T Time bound. Targets that do not indicate by when they should be achieved are weak targets. They have little chance of being achieved. Put a time limit to the target. For example: &quot;Reduce number of customer complaints from 6 to 2&quot; is specific and measurable, but lacks in time restriction. That is, in what time span must this happen? &ldquo;Reduce number of customer complaints from 6 in a week to 2 has a time limit&quot;.<br />\r\nOther examples include: 1. Compile the customer report and present it by 15 July. 2. Prepare the staff-training programme and costs for input into the budget by the end of the financial year. 3 Reduce the departmental costs by 15% within the next 6 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.1.2 The Appraisal Process<br />\r\nThe purpose of the Employee Performance Appraisal is to provide a regular, structured process for employees to receive feedback on the previous review period and to plan for the next review period.<br />\r\nStep 1 &ndash; Employee Performance Appraisal Forms are issued to Supervisors<br />\r\nStep 2 &ndash; Supervisor and employee agree key tasks to be reviewed, and agree date for the Appraisal Meeting which is a minimum of 2 weeks later<br />\r\nStep 3 &ndash; Employee completes relevant sections of the form and passes it to the supervisor a minimum of 2 days before the meeting<br />\r\nStep 4 &ndash; Supervisor completes relevant sections of the form<br />\r\nStep 5 &ndash; The appraisal meeting takes place at which supervisor and employee discuss their comments and complete Section 4 of the form together<br />\r\nStep 6 &ndash; Employee, supervisor and reviewing manager add any comments in Section 5 and sign the form<br />\r\nStep 7 &ndash; No later than 1 week after the appraisal meeting, the completed, signed form is passed to the HR department</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.1.3 The Appraisal Form<br />\r\nThe purpose of the Employee Performance Appraisal Form is to ensure that the discussion between the employee and their supervisor is documented clearly and that both employee and supervisor have an opportunity to comment on the content.<br />\r\nThe form represents a record of the appraisal meeting and becomes a working document for the supervisor and the employee, allowing each to check progress against the agreed action points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.1.4 Scheduling and Holding a Performance Meeting<br />\r\nThe purpose of the Appraisal Meeting is for the employee and supervisor to:-<br />\r\nReview the employee&rsquo;s performance over the review period<br />\r\nClarify comments<br />\r\nDiscuss different points of view<br />\r\nAgree actions for the next review period<br />\r\nTell the employee that you are initiating a scheduled performance review. Remind him/her of what is involved in the process. Schedule the meeting about two weeks in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Distribute the performance appraisal forms to staff at least two weeks before the actual performance meeting, for the staff to fill their inputs on their respective areas as prescribed in the forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before getting in a performance meeting, Appraiser should have sufficient contact with the employee to be making valid judgments. Don&rsquo;t comment on employee&rsquo;s race, sex, religion, nationality or a handicap or veteran status. Record major accomplishment, exhibited strength and weaknesses according to the dimensions on the appraisal form, and suggest actions and training or development to improve performance. Use example of behavior wherever you can in the appraisal to help avoid counting on hearsay. Always address behavior, not characteristic of personality. Be sure to address only the behavior of that employee, rather than behavior of other employee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Performance Appraisal Meeting:<br />\r\nState the meeting&rsquo;s goals of exchanging feedback and coming to actions plans, where necessary.<br />\r\nLet the employee speak first and give their input and then respond with your own input.<br />\r\nThen discuss areas where you disagree. Attempt to avoid defensiveness; admitting what you feel at the present time helps a great deal.<br />\r\nDiscuss behavior and not personalities.<br />\r\nEncourage participation and be supportive.<br />\r\nTry to end the meeting on a positive note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.1.5 Completing the Appraisal Form<br />\r\nSection Action Required Person Responsible<br />\r\n1 &ndash; Key Performance Indicators (KPI)<br />\r\nAppraisal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identification of up to 5 key tasks<br />\r\nEmployee Supervisor<br />\r\nDescription to include why these tasks are important, how they have performed in the task including individual effort and initiative involved, the resulting output.<br />\r\nAchievement must be stressed rather than efforts and initiatives involved<br />\r\nEmployees are encouraged to use examples<br />\r\nEmployee</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comment on employee&rsquo;s performance (optional)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supervisor<br />\r\nComment if any on Supervisor&rsquo;s rating in this part (optional)<br />\r\nEmployee</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2 &ndash; Behavioural Appraisal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comment on employee&rsquo;s behaviour<br />\r\nSupervisor</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: the People Management section is only to be used for employees with people management responsibilities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employees may add comments regarding the supervisor&rsquo;s comments in relation this section</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employee<br />\r\nSupervisor may put additional comments on Employee&rsquo;s behaviour ( Optional) Supervisor</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 &ndash; Skills Profile<br />\r\nSkills in which the employee is strong should include:<br />\r\nTechnical skills that are relevant to the role, in which the employee is strong<br />\r\nPotential strengths that the employee could bring to the role<br />\r\nSkills that are not required for the current role but which may be relevant in future roles</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employee</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skills needed to enhance effectiveness should include:<br />\r\nPotential areas for training, development or experiences that may enhance the employee&rsquo;s performance<br />\r\nNote that the HR department will use these recommendations to establish consolidated training needs with priority areas which may be included in the annual training calendar</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employee<br />\r\nSupervisor&rsquo;s comments (optional) Supervisor<br />\r\n4- Overall Rating and Comments The overall performance assessment rating in this section relates to the performance rating which best summarises the Staff member&#39;s performance over the period of review.<br />\r\nSupervisor will complete the overall rating based on individual ratings in section 1 and 2, using the percentage scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: Overall Score average should be measured as shown hereunder;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>101% and above = Good (G)<br />\r\n76% - 100% = Satisfactory (S)<br />\r\n51% - 75% = Partly Satisfactory (PS)<br />\r\n50% and below = Unsatisfactory (U)<br />\r\nThe ratings will be rated by supervisor on the space provided on the right side, and will be rated as follows;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating</p>\r\n\r\n<p>101% - and above<br />\r\nTo receive Good performance requires a level of performance above the expected and shown in the job description.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>76% - 100% Rating (Fully Satisfactory)<br />\r\nThe rating of Fully Satisfactory means that in all respects the Staff member has met the standards of Performance required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>51% - 75% (Partly satisfactory)<br />\r\nThe rating Partly Satisfactory means staff has not reached satisfactory level, however is relatively near the margin to reach the satisfactory level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>50% and below (Unsatisfactory)<br />\r\nThe rating Unsatisfactory should be regarded as constructive criticism and be accompanied by helpful suggestions on ways to improve. If a Staff member is rated as Unsatisfactory and the rating does not improve during the subsequent action plan period, then such a Staff member can be considered unsatisfactory. In such cases the supervisor should seek the advice of the Human Resources Department. We would expect a personal development plan for such an employee to be included in Section 3 of the performance assessment form. The Supervisor could also recommend that the staff be place on PIP.<br />\r\nSupervisor<br />\r\nSupervisor&rsquo;s comments on Employee&rsquo;s (Optional) average score Supervisor<br />\r\nEmployee comments on Supervisor&rsquo;s Ratings( Optional) Employee</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5 &ndash; Key Performance Goals<br />\r\nIdentification of at least 3 performance goals for the next review period.

The performance improvement plan or PIP identifies performance and/or behavioural issues that need to be corrected and creates a written plan of action to guide the improvement and/or corrective action.<br />\r\n5.2.2 Objectives of PIP<br />\r\nFundamentally, a PIP is a structured communication tool designed to facilitate constructive discussion between the employee and the supervisor. The key objectives will be:-<br />\r\nTo correct workplace behaviors affecting performance, productivity or staff relationships.<br />\r\nTo provide employees an opportunity to correct a situation rather than implementing a more serious step in the disciplinary process.<br />\r\nAn effective PIP will:<br />\r\nSpecifically identify the performance to be improved or the behavior to be corrected.<br />\r\nProvide clear expectations and metrics about the work to be performed or behavior that must change.<br />\r\nIdentify the support and resources available to help the employee make the required improvements.<br />\r\nEstablish a plan for reviewing the employee&#39;s progress and providing feedback to the employee for the duration of the PIP.<br />\r\nSpecify possible consequences if performance standards as identified in the PIP are not met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.2.3 Eligibility<br />\r\nAny staff can be placed on PIP up to and including Supervisors/Managers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.2.4 PIP Process for WCOs<br />\r\nFailure to achieve the following individual KPIs targets might result to PIP:<br />\r\nTotal Funded Borrowers<br />\r\nOutstanding Loan Book<br />\r\nGroup/Client Registration<br />\r\nLoan Disbursements<br />\r\nPAR (Should be below 3%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NB: For other support functions, we shall consider individual KPIs as per the Job Description.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 1 (Communication Phase)<br />\r\nWhen an employee is not performing or meeting expectations, the Branch Managers have at their disposal several options to correct the behavior. They will rely on corrective actions such as verbal warnings, continuous support and caution.<br />\r\nAt this stage, the BM must clearly communicate to the employee about the intention to place him/her on PIP if performance does not improve within 30 days and communicate the same to the COO and HR.<br />\r\nIn case the Branch Manager fails to initiate PIP discussions with a poor performing employee, the COO or HR have the right to instruct the BM to take this initiative.<br />\r\nPhase 2 (Yellow Phase)<br />\r\nIf the employee does not improve within a period of 1 month from when the communication was done; PIP will be administered. During this period the Branch manager will develop a growth plan for the WCO using the existing PIP templates and forward the filled in templates to the HR. The Branch Manager will also issue an official 1st warning letter which will be placed on the employees file.<br />\r\nPAR<br />\r\nIf PAR is still above 5%, the WCO may disburse loans to his or her repeat borrowers but not to new ones. New clients will be handed over to other WCOs under the supervision of the Branch Manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 3 (Orange Phase)<br />\r\nIf after the 2nd month the WCO is still below the agreed target, he/she will be moved to the Orange Phase. At this stage, the Branch Manager will issue the 2nd warning letter which will be placed on the employees file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAR<br />\r\nIf PAR is still above 5%, the WCO will focus 100% of his/her effort on recovery and shall not disburse any loans. Both repeat and new loans shall be disbursed by other WCOs. The WCO will be closely monitored and must have daily meetings with the Branch manager to discuss the daily action plan and progress made on the previous day&rsquo;s plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phase 4 (Red Phase)<br />\r\nDuring the Red Phase, the WCO will have spent a total of 3 months in PIP. If performance is still wanting, the WCO will meet the Performance Review Committee comprised of the Branch Manager, COO, HR and any other member of the Senior Management. During this meeting, the committee will reach a decision on how best to manage the WCOs portfolio going forward. Below is guidance on how the Review Committee should be administered: -<br />\r\nObjective is to reach a decision to revive the portfolio growth and ensure that Musoni is well protected.<br />\r\nThe Committee should look at how the WCO has developed from the day he/she was put on PIP<br />\r\nIf there is evidence that the WCOs performance was negatively affected for reasons beyond their control, the WCO will be given some more time to work out the portfolio. The minutes of the meeting will form the basis of the extension which should not exceed 2 months.<br />\r\nIf inadequate performance was achieved due to WCOs negligence, he/she will face further disciplinary action up to and including termination of service. The minutes of the committee will form the basis for this decision. Minutes of the meeting should include information on the following: -<br />\r\nIs the lack of portfolio growth and high PAR the result of WCOs negligence or policy violation?<br />\r\nWhy didn&rsquo;t the WCO meet the agreed performance standards?<br />\r\nWhat is the quality of the WCOs performance in terms of PAR management, customer service, interpersonal skills and teamwork?<br />\r\nIn case the employee is dissatisfied with the decision of the Performance Review Committee, he/she has 7 calendar days to appeal to the CEO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An employee cannot be on PIP more than once in 1 calendar year. In case an employee&rsquo;s performance deteriorates after reinstatement from PIP then Musoni will have no other option but to terminate the contract of employment without further notice.<br />\r\n6. SUCCESSION PLANNING<br />\r\n6.1 Introduction<br />\r\nSuccession Planning is an on-going process that identifies necessary competencies, and then works to assess, develop, and retain a talent pool of employees, in order to ensure continuity of leadership for all critical positions.<br />\r\n6.2 Objectives<br />\r\nTo proactively identify, assess and develop potential candidates for succession in the organization.<br />\r\nTo shield the business from unexpected circumstances and outline contingency plans.<br />\r\nTo ensure that the organization is not left in a vulnerable position.<br />\r\nTo determine the critical positions and build bench strength for current and future need.<br />\r\n6.3 Steps to Execute Succession Planning<br />\r\nIdentify key/critical positions in each Department or Branch.<br />\r\nDetermine the required job competencies for selected key positions.<br />\r\nDetermine the likelihood of these positions getting vacant in future.<br />\r\nAnalyse and match the competencies between the selected positions and employees who closely match the required competencies.<br />\r\nDecide on two successors for each position based on performance and potential.<br />\r\nEmployee with the closest match to competency requirements of the position will be the first successor to the position.<br />\r\nThe second successor will be the one with the second closest competency match to the position requirements.<br />\r\nProvide visibility, stretch assignments, growth projects and internal development opportunities for successors.<br />\r\nEnsure an effective pipeline is in place and reassess it against changing organizational needs and priorities.<br />\r\nPut a plan in place to address critical gaps.<br />\r\nGain support and commitment at all levels.<br />\r\n6.4 Succession Factors<br />\r\nPerformance<br />\r\nDemonstrated performance over the last 2 years based on attaining goals for the given year.<br />\r\nPotential - Capability to take on greater levels of responsibility given reasonable development opportunities.<br />\r\nRetention Risk - Impact to the business if the individual exits the organization and mitigation strategies.<br />\r\nReadiness - Assessment of candidates&rsquo; readiness: is he/she ready now, ready in 1-2 years, ready in 3-5 years.<br />\r\nGrowth and Development - Opportunities that can be provided to potential successors based on assessed gaps and readiness criteria, and completed succession charts for the critical roles.<br />\r\n6.5 Succession Summary Grids<br />\r\nName Performance Potential Retention Risk Readiness Actions/ Successor<br />\r\n(H, M, L) (H, M, L) (H, M, L) (Now, 1-2 years, 3-5 years) Development Plans (if candidate exits)<br />\r\n1<br />\r\n2<br />\r\n3<br />\r\n4<br />\r\n5<br />\r\n6<br />\r\nH - High<br />\r\nM - Medium<br />\r\nL &ndash; Low</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.6 Succession Chart (Sample)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annex 7: Candidates Profile Template &ndash; to be filled in by the candidates&rsquo; immediate supervisor and submitted to HR.

The conflict of interest policy is to ensure that the company&rsquo;s financial position, integrity and reputation are not compromised. The fundamental principal guiding the implementation of this policy is that no Musoni employee should have or appear to have personal interests or relationships that conflict with the best interest of Musoni. This conflict of interest policy is not exhaustive but examples of conflict of interest are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. An employee has directly or indirectly a financial or non-financial interest in a company with which Musoni intends to enter into a transaction or a company which is in competition with Musoni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii. He/she has a partner, child, parent or relative with a financial or non-financial interest in a company with which Musoni intends to enter into a transaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii.

Holding an interest in or accepting free or discounted goods from any organization that does, or is seeking to do business with Musoni Limited, by any employee who is in a position to directly or indirectly influence either Musoni&rsquo;s decision to do business or the terms upon which business would be done with that organization<br />\r\nvi. Be employed by (including a consultant) or serving on the board of any organization which does or is seeking to do business with Musoni Limited or which competes with Musoni Limited<br />\r\nConflict due to political activities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, a staff member who is involved in political activities shall inform Management accordingly and if a staff member intends to run for a political office, he/she should first terminate his/her employment with Musoni Kenya Limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conflict due to familial relations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employment of relatives is not allowed. Each employee shall immediately report to his superior any family relation up to the second degree (meaning first cousins, nephews and nieces) he has with other (potential) employees of Musoni. This is also the case if he intends to marry another (potential) employee of Musoni. In cases of close links, Musoni might decide to change or stop the function of either employee if that is in the interest of Musoni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duty of Disclosure</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the employee&rsquo;s responsibility to report to the immediate supervisor or the CHRO any actual or potential conflict that may exist between the employee and the company and to seek the company&rsquo;s written consent to continue to engage in the activity that poses actual or potential conflict interest with the company. The company will at its sole discretion allow or refuse the employee to continue with the activity.In the absence of a report, violations of the principles and standards contained in this policy shall be subject to discipline up to and including summary dismissal. The company shall have the final authority to determine the appropriate penalty for such violations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.2 Communication with the press</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A staff member, except with the prior express authorization of the Chief Executive Officer or designate, is forbidden to issue statements, or communicate with the press on Musoni Kenya Limited matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.3 Unauthorized disclosure of information (Confidentiality)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staff members shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to matters of official business and shall not, without prior written permission from the immediate supervisor or designate, disclose any information known to them that has not been made public. Staff members shall at no time, including after the end of service with Musoni Kenya Limited, use such confidential information for personal or third party advantage, unless authorized by the Management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only designated and authorized staff members shall make statements or express opinions on behalf of the Management of Musoni Kenya Limited to the press and media, including electronic media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.4 Personal Business</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conducting personal business using Musoni Kenya Limited office resources, including phones, computers, photocopiers, stationery and other equipment before, during or after office hours is not<br />\r\nallowed.<br />\r\n7.5 External commitments<br />\r\nBefore making any commitment, staff should disclose any possible part time employment, external consultancy and business activities that may interfere with their day to day work.

FAIR AND RESPECTFUL TREATMENT OF MUSONI CLIENTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni employees should treat clients with honesty, fairness and respect. Clients should be treated responsibly and must never be discriminated on personal characteristics of gender, ethnicity or affiliations (religion &amp; politics).

ATTENDANCE AND LEAVE PROCEDURES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each employee is important to the overall success of our operation. When you are not here, someone else must do your job. Consequently, you are expected to report to work on time at the scheduled start of the workday. Reporting to work on time means that you are ready to start work, not just arriving at work, at your scheduled starting time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company depends on its employees to be at work at the times and locations scheduled. Excessive absenteeism and/or tardiness will lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.1 Working hours</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The regularly scheduled workday for our business office is: Monday to Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m with a one-hour lunch break between 1:00pm and 2:00pm. These start and end times are only guidelines; you will be expected from time to time to work outside working hours to complete your daily tasks. You will be expected to observe punctuality at all times. If for some reason you shall be absent from duty, adequate notice should be given to your immediate supervisor. In this case the following leave procedures will apply: -</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.2 Leave<br />\r\nEmployees will be entitled to 25 annual leave days (working days) after twelve consecutive months of service.

In addition, the female employee is also entitled to her annual leave which can be taken before or after the maternity leave. A staff member shall apply for maternity leave at least one month before the expected delivery date (EDD) to allow time for proper handing over and due notice to be given to a staff member or reliever who may need to step in her absence. It is expected that the employee will resume duty after the expiry of her leave and continue with her normal duties. However, should a female employee require maternity leave during the probationary period, her probation will be deferred by the same number of days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Male employees are entitled to 2 weeks (14 calendar days) paternity leave. Application for Paternity leave should be done two weeks before the commencement date. Application for paternity leave must be supported by a copy of birth notification form which must be provided immediately after resuming from leave. Paternity leave can only be taken once in a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.2.3. Sick leave</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The employee will report before 09:30 to his or her supervisor in case of sickness or absence from work. After two consecutive months of service, an employee shall be entitled to a sick leave of not less than 7 (seven) days with full pay and thereafter to sick leave of 7 (seven) days with half pay in each period of twelve consecutive months of service. The 12 consecutive months commence from the date of employment and the anniversary thereof. A medical certificate signed by a duly qualified medical practitioner must be produced by the employee to confirm the inability to work and the duration of the incapacity for absence exceeding 3 consecutive working days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If an employee requires additional sick off other than what has been provided, he/she can request an additional period not exceeding two months of sick leave without pay which must be approved by the Management. If after the second month, the sickness of the employee still continues, Musoni Kenya Limited will be entitled to terminate the contract of employment on medical grounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.2.5. Compassionate Leave</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the event of the death of spouse, own child, sibling or parent, an employee shall be entitled to paid compassionate leave of not more than 5 working days per year, without any deductions from the annual leave. Any additional days needed for the above reason will be deducted from the employee&rsquo;s<br />\r\nannual leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*In the event that an employee is absent from work to take care of an ailing child or spouse, the days taken will be recovered from one&rsquo;s annual leave.<br />\r\n10. CUSTODY AND RETENTION OF STAFF MEMBERS RECORDS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All staff members&#39; documents and/or records shall be in the custody of and retained by the CHRO and they shall be kept in strictest confidence. It is your responsibility to provide current information regarding your address, telephone number, insurance beneficiaries, change in dependents, marital status, academic achievements etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, employee personnel files are the property of the company, and do not belong to the employee. However, upon request, the company will provide employees with copies of performance evaluations and other performance-related documents that the employee has previously received. Employees will have their job performance reviewed after every six months by their immediate supervisor. Copies of performance records will be placed in individual files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS AT WORKPLACE<br />\r\nThe company believes in maintaining safe and healthy working conditions for our employees. However, to achieve our goal of providing a safe workplace, each employee must be safety conscious. We have established the following policies and procedures that allow us to provide safe and healthy working conditions. We expect each employee to follow these policies and procedures, to act safely, and to report unsafe conditions to his or her supervisor in a timely manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.1 Reporting Unsafe Conditions or Practices</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employees are expected to continually be on the lookout for unsafe working conditions or practices. If you observe an unsafe condition, you should warn others, if possible, and report that condition to your supervisor immediately. If you have a question regarding the safety of your workplace and practices, ask your supervisor for clarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you observe a coworker using an unsafe practice, you are expected to mention this to the coworker and to your supervisor. Likewise, if a coworker brings to your attention an unsafe practice you may be using, please thank the coworker and make any necessary adjustments to what you are doing. Safety at work is a team effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.2 Reporting an Injury</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employees are required to report any injury, accident, or safety hazard immediately to their supervisor(s). Minor cuts or abrasions must be treated on the spot. A first aid box will be maintained in every work station to take care of minor injuries. More serious injuries or accidents will be treated accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.3 Care of Company property and Supplies</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All employees are expected to take care of all company property and supplies provided to them. You are responsible for maintaining this property in proper working condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neglect, theft, and/or destruction of the company&rsquo;s property are grounds for disciplinary action, up to</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and including termination of service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.4 Smoking at the Workplace</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s policy is to provide smoke-free environments for our employees, customers, and the general public. Smoking of any kind is prohibited inside our office and on our worksites. Employees may smoke on scheduled breaks or during meal times, as long as they do so outside the office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.5 Violence and Weapons<br />\r\nThe company believes in maintaining a safe and healthy workplace, in part by promoting open, friendly, and supportive working relationships among all employees. Violence or threats of violence have no place in our business. Violence is not an effective solution to any problem. Employees are strictly prohibited from bringing any weapons to the office. Neither threats of violence nor fighting will be tolerated. Furthermore, if you have a problem that is creating stress or otherwise making you agitated, you are encouraged to discuss it with your supervisor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are expected to immediately report to your supervisor any violation of this policy.

The use, possession, distribution, or sale of controlled substances such as drugs or alcohol, or being under the influence of such controlled substances is strictly prohibited while on duty, while on the company&rsquo;s premises. The use of illegal drugs is a threat to us all because it promotes problems with safety, customer service, productivity, and our ability to survive and prosper as a business. Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.7 Appearance and Dressing<br />\r\nTo present a business-like, professional image to our customers and the public, all employees are required to wear appropriate clothing on the job.

Salary shall be payable monthly in arrears by the end of each month, after deducting all legal amounts as required by law. The Board of Directors shall approve salary levels and the related structures. Consideration shall be given to prevailing market rates, inflationary changes and cost of living. All staff members&#39; salaries will be based on this salary structure. The Salary Structure is a framework for a transparent salaries and career path for all positions at Musoni Kenya (see Annex 9 - Current Salary Structure).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In determining a staff member&#39;s entry point into a particular level, his/her qualifications, past experience and general competence shall be considered. New staff on probation will be placed on the structure but will attract 90% of the salary. They will be entitled to 100% salary upon confirmation. If a<br />\r\nnew staff is hired on any other day other than the 1st day of the month, then his/her salary shall be computed according to the number of days worked in the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salaries appropriate to each level shall be monitored regularly and reviewed periodically.

Payroll preparation is a shared role between the HR Department and Finance Department.<br />\r\nHR ensures that people are paid correctly and on time by submitting monthly payroll changes in relation to additional staff, staff exits, confirmations, promotions, appointments and loan deductions. For a new employee to be included in the payroll, the following details must be submitted to the Chief Finance Officer or designate by the 18th day of every month.<br />\r\nFull name of the employee<br />\r\nDate of Employment<br />\r\nID Number<br />\r\nPIN Number<br />\r\nNSSF Number<br />\r\nNHIF Number<br />\r\nBank Account Number<br />\r\nBasic Salary and allowances<br />\r\nAppointments/ promotions must be supported by official appointment letters signed by the CEO.<br />\r\nOnce all the changes have been compiled, the HR will then send a soft copy folder of all the changes by email and also submit signed hard copy documents to the Chief Finance Officer for further payroll preparation and authorization as documented in the Accounting Manual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.3 Salary Advances<br />\r\nAn employee may apply for a salary advance when faced with emergency situations. Emergencies include death of a close family member or hospitalization of a close relative. This money will be given for compassionate related reasons only. The employee will need to request for the same in writing and forward the letter to the CHRO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amount of salary advanced to any one staff will depend on the salary; the borrower must remain with at least &frac12; (half) of the net salary after computing all other deductions appearing on the pay slip in a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.3.1 Staff Loans<br />\r\nMusoni provides attractive loan benefits to confirmed employees for both professional and personal development. The current loan facilities include: -<br />\r\nUnsecured loan facilities<br />\r\nEducational loan facility<br />\r\nCar loan facility for supervisors<br />\r\nPlot purchase and mortgage<br />\r\nLoan application forms and product specs will be provided by the HR department. Terms and conditions apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.4 Performance Based Bonus Scheme</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.4.1Bonus Objectives<br />\r\nThe revised bonus scheme is designed to motivate staff to achieve high performance levels, change behaviours and attitudes. The main objectives of the bonus scheme are as follows:<br />\r\nThe bonus should be aligned with the strategic objectives and growth of the Institution<br />\r\nMotivate staff to meet and exceed their monthly target.<br />\r\nSimple to calculate<br />\r\nFair &amp; transparent<br />\r\nPay bonus monthly<br />\r\nReward Achievement and Performance.<br />\r\n11.4.2 Target Staff<br />\r\nWe shall include only the WCOs and the BMs in the initial phase and as soon as we have reached Operational Break Even Point we will develop an Annual Performance based Bonus for Head Office Staff and Support Staff in the branches i.e. Customer Service Advisors.<br />\r\nThe following will also apply:-<br />\r\nStaff must be confirmed to earn a bonus<br />\r\nA female employee on maternity leave cannot earn a bonus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.4.3 Bonus Calculation for WCOs (GL)<br />\r\nThe revised bonus scheme puts into consideration 4 key variables namely number of disbursements, OLB, Total Funded Borrowers (TFB) &amp; PAR. The PAR section is a deduction and is designed to be punitive.<br />\r\nNumber of Disbursements<br />\r\nThe monthly target will be a minimum of 40 disbursements. If the WCO exceeds the minimum monthly target, he/she will be rewarded for each loan in excess of 40 per month. Disbursements will include Wepesi Loans.<br />\r\nLD= Loan Disbursements&gt;40&times;Kshs.200<br />\r\nOutstanding Loan Balance (OLB)<br />\r\nA WCO will earn 0.21% of the value of his/her outstanding loan portfolio above Kshs. 5M.<br />\r\nOlB=Outstanding Loan Balance&gt;Kshs 5 million&times;0.21%<br />\r\nTotal Funded Borrowers (TFB)<br />\r\nThe revised bonus scheme has been designed to spur growth and motivate staff to meet and exceed their monthly targets. For Musoni to reach operational breakeven point, each WCO should have achieved at least 330 Total Funded Borrowers. To encourage our WCOs to keep growing their client base, this variable will be treated as follows:-<br />\r\nTotal Funded Borrowers %age of Bonus Earnings<br />\r\n&lt;200 0%<br />\r\n&gt;200&lt;231 20%<br />\r\n&gt;232&lt;263 40%<br />\r\n&gt;264&lt;295 60%<br />\r\n&gt;296&lt;330 80%<br />\r\n&lt;331 100%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portfolio at Risk (PAR)<br />\r\nThe Arrears section of the bonus scheme is a deduction and is designed to be punitive. For every 1% of PAR&gt;1 (otherwise known as PAR Total) the bonus payout is reduced by 20%. It follows that at PAR Of 5% the whole bonus is wiped out (100%) as follows.<br />\r\nPAR Total % of Bonus Awarded<br />\r\nPAR&gt;5% 0 bonus &amp; PIP<br />\r\nPAR =5% 0 bonus &amp; Lending Stop<br />\r\nPAR =4% 20% bonus<br />\r\nPAR =3% 40% bonus<br />\r\nPAR =2% 60% bonus<br />\r\nPAR =1% 80% bonus<br />\r\nPAR =0% 100% bonus<br />\r\n11.4.4 Bonus Calculation for Individual Loan Officers (ILOs)<br />\r\nIL is a fairly new product that has been developed in 2013. Our intention is to grow the IL loan book by 50% of the total loan book by the end of 2014. The bonus will put into consideration 4 main variables as follows:-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total Funded Borrowers (TFB)<br />\r\nThe minimum thresh hold will be 35 clients. For an ILO to be eligible for the bonus, he/she must have achieved at least 35 Total Funded Borrowers.<br />\r\nOutstanding Loan Balance (OLB)<br />\r\nAn ILO will earn 0.21% of the value of his/her outstanding loan portfolio above Kshs. 5.0M.<br />\r\nOLB=Outstanding Loan Balance&gt;Kshs 5.0 million X 0.21%<br />\r\nNumber of Disbursements<br />\r\nThe monthly target will be a minimum of 7 disbursements. If the ILO exceeds the minimum monthly target, he/she will be rewarded for each loan in excess of 7 per month.<br />\r\nLD= Loan Disbursements&gt;7 x Kshs.200<br />\r\nPortfolio at Risk (PAR)<br />\r\nThe Arrears section of the bonus scheme is a deduction and is designed to be punitive. For every 1% of PAR&gt;1 (otherwise known as PAR Total) the bonus payout is reduced by 20%. It follows that at PAR Of 5% the whole bonus is wiped out (100%) as follows.<br />\r\nPAR Total % of Bonus Awarded<br />\r\nPAR&gt;5% 0 bonus &amp; PIP<br />\r\nPAR =5% 0 bonus &amp; Lending Stop<br />\r\nPAR =4% 20% bonus<br />\r\nPAR =3% 40% bonus<br />\r\nPAR =2% 60% bonus<br />\r\nPAR =1% 80% bonus<br />\r\nPAR =0% 100% bonus</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.4.5Bonus Calculation for Branch Managers (BM)<br />\r\nBranch Managers bear the greatest responsibility for achieving the branch target. The bonus calculation for each Branch Manager is related to the WCOs bonus at the branch they are working for.<br />\r\nBM Bonus = 10% of the total net bonus of WCOs in his/her branch.<br />\r\nFor Branches with Mashinanis, the Branch Manager will earn 10% of the total net bonus of WCOs in the Main Branch and 5% of the total net bonus of Mashinani WCOs.<br />\r\n11.4.6 Bonus Calculation for Mashinani SWCOs<br />\r\nMashinani SWCOs are the Individual Loan Officers in their respective Mashinanis. They also bear overall responsibility of the Mashinani in terms of leadership, supervision and portfolio growth. The bonus calculation for each SWCO is related to the WCOs bonus at the Mashinani they are working for.<br />\r\nMashinani SWCO Bonus = ILO Bonus + 5% of the total net bonus of WCOs in his/her Mashinani.<br />\r\n11.4.7 Conclusion<br />\r\nAn incentive scheme is a direct way of measuring performance based on specific targets set by the Institution. The revised bonus scheme has powerful effects on the performance and productivity of WCOs, ILOs, SWCOs and Branch Managers.<br />\r\nThis scheme relies on individual efficiency. It is expected to improve loan disbursements, grow OLB and reduce delinquency thereby boosting the overall performance of the institution.<br />\r\nNote:<br />\r\nThe Management will review the Bonus after every 6 months and ensure that the total amount paid out does not exceed 20% of the total WCO gross pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.5 Medical Cover</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You and your family (spouse and up to a maximum of four (4) children) will be included in a medical scheme that includes outpatient and inpatient cover after probationary period and confirmation of appointment. Members will be educated on the cover upon joining. In case a member of staff exceeds the limit provided, any extra monies shall be paid by the staff in case of outpatient or inpatient including maternity. The CHRO should be notified on any inpatient cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.6 Pension<br />\r\nOn successful completion of your probation, you will become eligible to participate in the staff contributory pension scheme. The company will contribute 10% of your basic salary towards Staff Contributory Pension Scheme, with an additional 5% to be contributed by you as a payroll deduction. This sum is payable to you upon termination of service or upon retirement as per Retirement Benefits Authority (RBA) terms and regulations.<br />\r\nThe company however reserves the right to change the nature, quality or level of these benefits at any time without reference to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12. DISCIPLINARY CODE AND PROCEDURE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.1 Policy Statement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni Kenya Limited is an institution requires our staff to ascribe to high standards of ethics and integrity. This code of discipline is therefore intended to ensure that staff are responsive to these standards. The purpose of this code therefore is not to set a list of dos and don&#39;ts but rather to establish an ethical base upon which Musoni Kenya Limited can achieve client satisfaction and shareholder value. It is therefore essential that staff are aware of the situations which could lead to disciplinary action and the resulting consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.2 Principles</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Disciplinary process is premised on prevention and rehabilitation rather than on being punitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; All disciplinary action taken should be through the due disciplinary process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; To ensure that staff who have breached the disciplinary code are treated justly and with consistency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.3 Disciplinary Code</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The disciplinary code contains two categories of infractions:. Misconduct and Gross misconduct. This however will not preclude management from taking action against misconduct not mentioned in the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.3.1 Misconduct:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definition: Misconduct shall include violations of Musoni Kenya Limited operational rules and procedures that do not necessarily amount to gross misconduct but may affect the continuity, and efficiency of Musoni operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Misconduct may result in either verbal or written warnings to the employee as per the progressive disciplinary process. Any violation of the rules after a final written warning has been issued shall be classified as Gross Misconduct for which an employee will be liable to Dismissal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fallowing are examples of Misconduct that may result in either verbal or written warnings to the employee</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Late coming</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Absenteeism</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Failure to achieve set performance targets</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Misuse of Musonis property or name</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Being involved in actions that bring Musoni Kenya into disrepute</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Physical Violence<br />\r\nThe foregoing procedure (progressive disciplinary process) shall be invoked following any misconduct by an employee.<br />\r\n12.3.2 Disciplinary Process</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definition: Progressive discipline is a system where the severity of the disciplinary penalty increases each time an employee commits an ordinary infraction amounting to Misconduct. Typically the progression will normally begin at the lowest step in the progressive discipline process but may be advanced dependent upon the seriousness of the performance or infraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serious infractions amounting to gross misconduct shall not be subjected to the progressive disciplinary process but shall be referred to a disciplinary panel/committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.3.3 Guiding Principles</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Degrees of discipline are progressive and are used to ensure the employee has the opportunity to correct their performance. Factors to be considered are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The variety and number of problems involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The seriousness of the violation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The time interval and employee response to prior disciplinary action(s).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Previous work history of the employee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, verbal warnings should, at the next violation, be followed by a Written Warning, followed at the next violation by suspension or final warning, then dismissal. This is especially true in those cases where the time interval between the violations is short and the employee isn&#39;t remorseful about their indiscipline or demonstrates a lack of desire to improve his/her performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following disciplinary penalties shall be used in progression as appropriate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a) Verbal Warning b) Written Warning<br />\r\nc) Final Written Warning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>d) Dismissal, Summary Dismissal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Progression of Disciplinary Process:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following processes from verbal warning to final warning shall be administered at the department level assisted by the Chief Human Resources Officer and shall not necessitate a formal disciplinary hearing:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a) Verbal warning: The Verbal Warning is a conversation between a supervisor and an employee held in private about a disciplinary or performance problem. It is the first step of the progressive disciplinary process. Like all other disciplinary actions Verbal warnings must be documented and sent<br />\r\nto the Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO) to be placed on the employees file.<br />\r\nb) Written warning: A written warning is a documented formal conversation between a supervisor and an employee about a disciplinary or performance problem. It is the second step of the progressive disciplinary process. The Written Warning is usually used only after a Verbal Warning has been given and no change in performance has resulted. Upon documenting the conversation, the supervisor shall request the employee to sign against it and forward it to the CHRO to be placed on the employee&#39;s file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c) Final Written Warning: A final written warning is a documented formal conversation between a Head of Department and an employee about a continuing disciplinary or performance problem. It is the third step in the progressive discipline process. The purpose of the Final Written Warning is to correct a performance problem by discussing it with the employee and providing a written record of that conversation. This is a last chance step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When to use a Final Written Warning: The Final Written Warning is used after a Verbal Warning and Written Warning have been given by the employee&#39;s immediate supervisor and no change in performance has resulted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.3.4 Warning Procedures</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is desirable for all Heads of departments plus Branch Managers to follow the following steps before a verbal warning, written warning or final warning is issued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Talk to the employee privately (in an office, Board room or other quiet area).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; State the specific problem in terms of desired performance and actual performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Refer to previous informal counseling about the problem if it&#39;s a verbal warning or previous verbal or written warnings in subsequent cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Give the employee a chance to respond and explain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Tell the employee the specific change in his/her performance which you expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Have the employee confirm that he/she knows exactly what you expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Indicate your confidence in his/her ability to perform properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Document the conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Required Information</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The warning letter must contain the following information:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a) The date of the conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b) The specific rule violation or performance problem that has occurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c) A reference to previous Informal counseling or warning notices about the problem.<br />\r\nd) A statement of the specific change in the employee&#39;s performance or behaviour you expect. e) Any comments or statements the employee made during the conversation.<br />\r\nf) A statement indicating your confidence in the employee&#39;s ability to perform properly in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>g) Have the employee sign the memo. If the employee refuses, a statement regarding your attempt to have the employee sign and his/her refusal to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Role of Documentation in the Disciplinary Process</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Documentation is an essential element of the disciplinary process. Documentation ensures that a manager accurately remembers the goals that he/she has set for an employee, whether performance standards were met, why standards were not met, and how an employee performed months before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without documentation, a manager is unable to provide an employee with specific examples of performance. The more complete and accurate the documentation, the easier it is for a manager to make and substantiate an evaluation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Documentation is also critical when a manager/supervisor needs to substantiate his actions to others. In the event that an evaluation, pay raise, or disciplinary action is challenged, documentation will be the key to supporting that action. Memory alone will not be substantial enough to support a decision when grievances, disciplinary hearings, and unfair dismissal suits arise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.3.5 Gross Misconduct</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gross Misconduct includes any violation of Musoni Kenya Limited rules and regulations of such a degree that continued employment of the individual shall not be desirable. The following are examples of some scenarios that amount to Gross Misconduct warranting an employee&#39;s instant dismissal:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Absenteeism from work without permission</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Incapability whilst on duty brought on by alcohol or illegal drugs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Negligence of duty &ndash; if one willfully neglects to perform any work which was his duty to perform or if one carelessly performs any work that was his duty to perform under his contract of employment that might cause unacceptable loss, damage or injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Use of abusive language or behaving in a manner that is insulting to his/her employer or to a person in authority. This includes assault, battery or intimidation of other staff members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Insubordination - refusal to obey a command from a senior officer which is within the scope of your duty to perform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; If an employee breaks the law and is arrested and imprisoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Theft, fraud or deliberate falsification of records</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Serious breach of confidentiality</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Conflict of interest</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.3.6 Disciplinary Process and Procedure for Gross Misconduct</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon the commission of a violation amounting to gross misconduct an employee will immediately be relieved of his/her duties and shall be placed on investigative suspension by the Disciplinary Committee which shall consist of the [CEO, CHRO, Head of Department and any other member of the Management Team] An investigative suspension is a period during which an employee is relieved of his or her job with half pay, because of allegations of Gross misconduct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some circumstances it may be necessary to suspend the employee for a period whilst enquiries are made. The purpose of the suspension is to make a full investigation to determine the facts of the case. Investigative suspension shall not exceed 30days or the duration of the investigation whichever is shorter but in all cases where such investigation exceeds 30 days, the employee&#39;s salary shall be restored to full pay until the investigation is complete. In cases where the employee is absolved, his<br />\r\n/her outstanding pay for the duration of the suspension shall be paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In cases where the misconduct does not necessitate further investigation the employee will be dismissed from our employment without notice. The power to dismiss shall be vested in the disciplinary committee. The committee shall, before terminating the employment of an employee or summarily dismissing an employee hear and consider any representations which the employee makes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An employee whose contract is terminated summarily shall lose his entitlement to the normal terminal benefits including, notice pay. However, such employee shall be entitled to pay for actual days<br />\r\nworked during the month in which the dismissal occurs, and accrued leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES<br />\r\nGrievance is any dissatisfaction or feeling of injustice on the part of the employee in connection with his/her work situation, management&#39;s decision, or disciplinary action against him/her</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any individual staff member wishing to seek redress for grievances relating to his/her employment will in the first instance report the grievance or dispute to his/her Manager/Supervisor and/or the CHRO or designate in writing who shall undertake to investigate the problem without delay and seek resolution. If the staff member feels that his/her grievance or dispute cannot be dealt with or easily resolved through either of these channels, he/she will resort to the CEO, whose role will be to handle and mediate appeals, cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A staff member who perceives that he/she is subject to harassment and/or intimidation shall immediately report his/her complaint in writing to his/her supervisor or the CHRO or designate The staff member accused of harassment and/or intimidation shall be advised immediately in writing and invited to present his/her case. Resolution shall be sought as quickly as possible</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grievance procedure will be subject to review by management on a regular basis. The grievance procedure has the objective of resolving disputes internally. The employee should only invoke this procedure if he remains dissatisfied. Grievance reports should be dealt with in strict confidentiality by the involved employee, the witness and by Musoni. This procedure applies to all employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 1: Statement of grievance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The employee should set out the grievance in writing and send it to his direct supervisor. Without such a written statement, Musoni has no obligation to take the grievance to a meeting. The statement should be addressed, be headed by the word &ldquo;Grievance&rdquo; and should clearly include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The problem</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; How it affects the employee</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Who and what causes it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; What the employee thinks Musoni and the employee should do about it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2: Meeting</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as reasonably possible after receiving the statement, Musoni will invite the involved employee to attend a meeting to discuss the grievance. The meeting will be arranged as quickly as possible after Musoni had a reasonable opportunity to consider the response. Afterwards Musoni will inform the involved employee in writing what Musoni has decided to do about the grievance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3: Appeal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The employee must write to Musoni if he wishes to appeal against the Musoni decision within a week after he received the written decision of Musoni. Musoni will then invite the employee to attend a further meeting. If deemed necessary by Musoni, Musoni shall be represented at the appeal meeting by a more senior person than attended the first meeting. After the appeal meeting, Musoni will inform<br />\r\nall involved of the final decision.<br />\r\n14. TERMINATION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This policy sets out the conditions and procedures relating to termination of employment with Musoni. It aims to ensure that Musoni is in line with good employment practice and complies with the statutory requirements. Termination shall fall under the following categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14.1 Retirement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The retirement age in Musoni Kenya Limited is 60 years. This shall in no way preclude management from offering a particular employee a further term on a fixed contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14.2 Expiry of Contract</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contracts of service that have run their term shall for purposes of this section be considered terminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14.3 Incapacity</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incapacity should be certified by a medical doctor appointed by Musoni Kenya Limited confirming that an employee is incapable of carrying out his/her duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14.4 Death</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Death shall automatically discharge a contract of employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14.5 Resignation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where an employee terminates his/her contract of service by giving the requisite notice stipulated in their contracts. The following steps shall be followed:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 1: Submission of Resignation Letter</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any staff that wishes to terminate his employment must submit a letter of resignation to the Chief Human Resources Officer with a copy to the Immediate Supervisor. The immediate supervisor should endorse the letter to signify his/her acknowledgement of the resignation and send the copy to the CHRO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2: Return of Musoni Property</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon leaving the service of Musoni, the employee must handover to the immediate supervisor or designated officer all accounts, contracts, data, records and documents whether in paper, tape, diskette or electronic form related to his /her job. Musoni reserves the right to deduct from the employees&rsquo; final dues any amount equivalent to the value of any property that is not returned or damaged and any other amount due to Musoni Kenya limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3 Staff Exit Interview</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Human Resources Department will normally conduct an exit interview with the resigning employee to obtain a better understanding of his needs to solicit his feedback in Musonis policies and practices so as to improve the overall working environment and conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 4 Final Dues</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final payment including basic salary, job related payments or reimbursements, payments in lieu of accrued annual leave and money due to the employee (if any) will be paid to the resigned employee within 30 days from the effective date of handover and clearance.<br />\r\n14.6 Disciplinary Process</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contract of service may be terminated through the disciplinary process, either by summary dismissal or dismissal with notice. Consequently, if a staff member&#39;s performance does not measure up fully to the requirements of their post at the time of their appraisal for two consecutive appraisal periods, and he/she receives a poor or below average rating, the Supervisor has the option of recommending demotion or termination all of which shall follow the disciplinary procedure. (See Annex 6: Appraisal Form).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14.7 Other Instances of termination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Terminations resulting from Restructuring, Mergers and Acquisitions, downsizing and/or Rightsizing also known as laying off, Retrenchment, Redundancy, Abolition of Office or by whatever technical name that may be used at the time:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Management shall always ensure that the process is carried out in a fair manner and that employees are informed ahead of time. In circumstances where such notification may pause a risk to the company&rsquo;s business, management may opt to notify the Labour Office instead. Musoni shall come up with criteria to determine who shall be affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Labour Officer shall always be notified of any such layoffs not less than a month prior to the date of the intended date of termination. Such notification shall include the reasons for the terminations,<br />\r\nnumber and categories of the affected employees plus particulars of terminal benefits.<br />\r\n15.

In line with this commitment, and the Board and the management is committed to open communication. This policy aims to provide an avenue for Musoni employees to raise concerns and reassurance that they will be protected from reprisals or victimization for whistleblowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whistleblowing policies are generally intended to make it easier for members of staff to be able to report irregularities in good faith, without having to fear that their action may have adverse consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Whistleblowing Policy is a key element for safeguarding the Musoni&rsquo;s integrity. It is aimed at enhancing transparency and underpinning its system for combating practices that might damage its activities and reputation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protecting the integrity and reputation of MUSONI requires the active support of all members of MUSONI&rsquo;s staff, who are required to report incidents of suspected fraud, corruption, collusion and coercion, and other serious infringements of the rules and policies in force at MUSONI. Members of staff must also cooperate in investigations into such incidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By creating an environment of trust and maximum protection for the members of its staff, MUSONI wants to encourage them to cooperate in full. It is putting in place arrangements that will ensure that members of staff who report irregularities in good faith are afforded the utmost confidentiality and greatest degree of and most effective protection possible against any retaliation or reprisals, whether actual or threatened, as a result of their whistleblowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BASIC PRINCIPLES</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic principles of MUSONI&rsquo;s Whistleblowing Policy are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>the persons concerned must have a choice between a number of channels for whistleblowing and communication; in certain circumstances, they must be able to bypass the main channels for whistleblowing if these prove inappropriate;</li>\r\n	<li>members of staff must not under any circumstances be subject to reprisals for whistleblowing;</li>\r\n	<li>members of staff who report incidents in good faith must be protected and their identity must insofar as possible remain confidential;</li>\r\n	<li>the reported incidents shall be verified in the appropriate manner and, if they are confirmed, MUSONI shall take all necessary steps to identify appropriate remedies;</li>\r\n	<li>the basic rights of any person implicated by the reported incidents must be respected, whilst ensuring that the procedures provided for are effective.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc287955897\"></a>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SCOPE OF THE POLICY</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>MUSONI&rsquo;s Whistleblowing Policy applies to all permanent staff members and any other person providing MUSONI with services, including consultants and other service providers under contract (grouped together for the purposes of this document under the term &ldquo;staff member(s)&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REPORTING OBLIGATIONS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of staff are required to report any suspected or presumed incidents of illegal behaviour in the activities of MUSONI or of serious misconduct or serious infringement of MUSONI&rsquo;s rules, policies or guidelines, or any action that is or could be harmful to the mission or reputation of MUSONI (hereinafter &ldquo;irregularities&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such incidents may involve members of staff, borrowers, promoters, contractors, suppliers, beneficiaries or any other persons or entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of staff are required to cooperate in any official investigation, audit or similar request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No members of staff may use their position to prevent other members of staff from exercising their rights or complying with their obligations as indicated above.&nbsp;<a name=\"_Toc287955899\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS AND ANONYMITY</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is up to staff members to choose the most appropriate channel for reporting incidents which they must disclose. However, if a matter is reported to an authority that is not competent to deal with it, it is up to that authority to transmit, in strictest confidence, the relevant information and documents to the competent authority and to inform the member of staff accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The confidentiality and anonymity of persons making complaints or expressing concerns will be maintained to the fullest extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an investigation unless required by law to break that confidentiality. The Board encourages you to supply contact information with your submission to facilitate clarification and any assistance with possible investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To assist the Board in reviewing and, if necessary, investigating your complaints or concerns, you should provide as much factual, rather than speculative, information as possible. To the extent possible, you should include the following information in your submission:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>the alleged event, matter or issue that is the subject of the complaint or concern;</li>\r\n	<li>the name of each person you believe involved;</li>\r\n	<li>if the complaint or concern involves a specific event or events, the approximate date(s) and location(s) of each event; and</li>\r\n	<li>any additional information, documentation or other evidence you believe support the complaint or concern.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc287955903\"></a>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROTECTION OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Any staff member who reports an irregularity, provided that this is done in good faith and in compliance with the provisions of this policy, shall be protected against any acts of retaliation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the purposes of this policy, &quot;retaliation&quot; is defined as any action or threat of action which is unjustly detrimental to the whistleblower because of his/her report, including, but not limited to, harassment, discrimination and acts of vindictiveness, direct or indirect, that are recommended, threatened or taken against the whistleblower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Good faith&rdquo; can be taken to mean the unequivocal belief in the veracity of the reported incidents, i.e. the fact that the member of staff reasonably believes the transmitted information to be true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staff members, who make a report in bad faith, particularly if it is based knowingly on false or misleading information, shall not be protected and shall be subject to disciplinary measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc287955905\"></a>8.1 Protective measures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The protection of a person reporting an irregularity shall be guaranteed first of all by the fact that their identity will be treated in confidence. This means that their name will not be revealed, unless the whistleblower personally authorises the disclosure of his/her identity or this is a statutory requirement, particularly if it is essential to ensure that the right of the persons implicated to be given a fair hearing is upheld. In such a case, person handling the report (one of the three persons mentioned above) shall be required to notify the whistleblower before revealing their identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8.2 No Retaliation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No member of staff who in good faith reports irregularity shall suffer harassment, retaliation or adverse employment consequence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where members of staff consider that they have been the victim of retaliation for reporting an irregularity or have good reason to believe or fear that they are exposed to a risk of retaliation as a result of their reporting an irregularity, they shall be entitled to complain to the any other person mentioned above and request that protective measures be adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authority approached shall assess the circumstances of the case referred to it and may recommend to the BOD that temporary and/or permanent measures that are necessary in the interests of MUSONI be adopted with a view to protecting the staff member in question. The staff member shall be informed in writing of the results of this procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRAINING OF THE STAFF ON WHISTLEBLOWING</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All Musoni staff will be trained on the whistleblowing at all levels of the organization in relation to whistleblowing law and the organization&rsquo;s policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>HANDLING REPORTED VIOLATIONS</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>All reports will be promptly investigated and treated consistently and fairly within 60 days from the day of reporting. Appropriate corrective action will be taken if warranted by the investigation. The complainant will be informed that follow-up has or is occurring within two weeks after the Executive Director or board officer has received the complaint or report. The Executive Committee shall be informed of all such complaints or reports</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a name=\"_Toc287955906\"></a>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PENALTIES FOR RETALIATING</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Any form of retaliation undertaken by a staff member against any person for reporting an irregularity in good faith is prohibited and considered to be a serious breach of the loyalty and professional ethics requirements of MUSONI&rsquo;s Code of Conduct. In such a case disciplinary measures shall be taken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of staff will be informed of the measures taken by MUSONI following the discovery of acts of retaliation for reporting an incident. The information provided will not contain any data that will enable the people concerned to be identified.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><a name=\"_Toc287955907\"></a>11.1RIGHTS OF PERSONS IMPLICATED</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Any staff member implicated by reports of irregularities must be notified in good time of the allegations made against them, provided that this notification does not impede the progress of the procedure for establishing the circumstances of the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any event, findings referring to a staff member specifically by name may not be made upon the completion of the above-mentioned procedure, unless that staff member has had the opportunity to put forward their comments in keeping with the principle of respect for the right to be given a fair hearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After having heard the implicated staff member, or after having requested the latter to put their case in writing if, for objective reasons, it is not possible to hear them directly, the person handling the report (one of the three persons mentioned above) shall decide on the measures required in MUSONI&rsquo;s interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the reporting of irregularities and/or the ensuing procedure will involve dealing with personal data, such data shall be managed in keeping with the principles and rules provided for in the regulations applicable to MUSONI. Those involved in the reporting procedure and in any related procedure, including whistleblowers themselves, may contact the GM at any time in order to check that the rights conferred by the relevant provisions have been respected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANNUAL REPORTING</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of each year the Head of Internal Audit shall report on how the organizations reputation has been saved or how it has been saved from making losses by a whistle blower</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODIFICATION</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Audit Committee or the Board of Directors of Musoni Kenya can modify this Policy unilaterally at any time without notice.

Introduction</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.1 Overview</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni Kenya is the world&rsquo;s first cash free microfinance Institution. It was conceived as a Next Generation Microfinance Institution whose aim is to use Technology to deliver more efficient, lower cost microfinance services to the financially excluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.2 Purpose and Scope</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internal Audit Manual is intended to provide the Internal Auditor with practical guidance, tools and information for managing the internal audit activity and for planning, conducting and reporting on internal audit assurance engagements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.3 Applicability</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This manual is designed for Musoni Internal Auditors who are primarily responsible for carrying out the internal audit function across all the departments and branches. This manual is intended for internal use by Musoni Internal Auditors</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.4 Business model</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni has a business model with the following characteristics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>No cash transactions: nearly full usage of Electronic Funds Transfer, where the bulk of transactions are handled via mobile payment providers.</li>\r\n	<li>Central services concept: Musoni kenya manages all the administrative aspect of Musonis system while Musoni Services are involved in the development of the system.</li>\r\n	<li>Automation: significant reliance on automated procedures and controls according to predefined parameters.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.5 Audit function</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The audit function checks if approved procedures, processes and transactions are being followed. Furthermore, the auditor evaluates the validity, accuracy and completeness of documentation and other information as regards financial, accounting, administrative, managerial and operational functions of Musoni. Finally, the auditor identifies and reports to the management and Audit Committee actual and potential weakness of the internal control systems and recommends feasible remedies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internal audit activity adds value to the organization ( and its stakeholders) when it provides objective and relevant assurance and contributes to the effectiveness and efficiency of governance, risk, management and control processes.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To perform her/his tasks, the auditor checks observed activities against approved procedures as laid down in the company&rsquo;s manuals and the law. The auditor uses these manuals and the law as a basis to perform the audit checks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.6 Internal Audit Code of Ethics</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internal Audit department will apply and uphold the organisational and professional codes of conduct in order to promote an ethical culture in the profession of internal auditing. The code of Ethics for Internal auditors has four main principles: Integrity, Objectivity, Competence and Confidentiality as explained below;-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.6.1 Integrity</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Internal Auditors should demonstrate integrity. Relationships should be based on honesty and fairness. This encourages trust in the work of the auditor and underlies the reliance that is placed on that work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.6.2 Objectivity</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Audits should be undertaken with an objective state of mind. One that has considers all relevant issues without being unduly influenced by personal interest of others views. This is required in the formation of opinions, judgements and recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.6.3 Competence</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Code of Practice for Internal Audit requires that Auditors apply the knowledge, skills and experience required in their audits. Internal Auditors should not perform work that they are not competent to undertake, unless they have been adequately trained or supported to perform the work to the required standard. The internal audit shall continually improve its proficiency, effectiveness and quality of its services.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.6.4 Confidentiality</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the trust in relationships there is an expectation of that Auditors safeguard the information that they receive. Any disclosure of information should be authorised only on the basis that there is a legal or professional requirement to do so. Any information gathered in an audit must not be used for personal benefit or in any manner that would be contrary to the law or detrimental to the legitimate and ethical objectives of the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.7 Internal Audit Charter</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The auditor works according to the internal audit charter. This charter is given in annex 8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internal Audit Charter<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>details the roles and responsibilities of the internal auditor and the Audit Committee, for establishing an internal audit function that is appropriately resourced and managed in accordance with this policy and professional internal auditing standards. The Internal Audit Charter also addresses the objectivity and independence of the internal audit function and its authority to access departmental records and employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>1.8 Zero tolerance policy</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni uses a zero tolerance policy against fraud and deliberate mistakes. Fraud always leads to removal of the involved employee(s) and possibly to prosecution (see also Manual 04: Human Resources).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>2.0 Reporting Lines and Appointment</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2.1 Reporting lines of the auditor</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chief Internal Auditor will report functionally to the Board Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Executive Officer. Administrative reporting typically includes; budgeting and management accounting, Human resource administration, internal communications and information flows, administration of the organization&rsquo;s internal policies and procedures like expense approvals, floor space etc. ( Reference: Practice Advisory 1110-2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Board Audit Committee will review the performance of the Chief Internal Auditor every year. The Chief Internal Auditor will communicate and interact directly with the Board Audit Committee, including in executive sessions and meetings as appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2.2 Employing the internal auditor</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiring, assessment and firing of the&nbsp;Musoni Kenya&nbsp;auditor needs a majority approval of the Musoni Kenya Audit Committee members. Hence, the Musoni Kenya CEO cannot hire or fire this auditor without approval of this committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2.3 Selecting the external auditor</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association and Shareholders Agreement, Musoni Shareholders will be responsible for selection of the external auditors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>2.4 Selecting the Musoni Kenya Audit Committee</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Musoni Kenya Board appoints the members of the Musoni Kenya Audit Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>3.0 Managing internal audit function</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Internal auditors should possess the knowledge, skills, and other competencies needed to perform their individual responsibilities. The internal audit activity collectively should possess or obtain the knowledge, skills and other competencies to perform its responsibilities. IIA Standard 1210</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chief Internal Auditor should effectively manage the internal audit activity to ensure it adds value to the organization IIA Standard 2000</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>3.1 Internal audit organisational structure</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chief Internal Auditor reports directly to Musoni board through the Audit Committee. Below is the current Internal Audit structure;-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>4.0.&nbsp; Reporting</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4.1 Reporting format</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The internal auditor issues a written report after every audit. Additionally, the auditor gives oral explanations if asked by the auditee of the report.?) The audit report should be accurate, objective, clear, concise, constructive, complete and timely. The audit report includes (see annex 1 for the reporting format):</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Criteria: the standards, measures or expectations set by Musoni against which the conditions are tested</li>\r\n	<li>Conditions: a description of the issues that the auditor found, supported by evidence and examples</li>\r\n	<li>Cause: the likely reasons why the conditions do not meet the criteria</li>\r\n	<li>Effects: the actual or potential risks that Musoni faces if the conditions continue.

It is noted that making these plans is a management responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4.2 Briefing the auditee</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The internal auditor should formally discuss all significant audit findings and conclusions with the auditee management before the report is drafted. This formal debriefing helps ensure that there are no &ldquo;surprises&rdquo; with respect to reporting results and that there have been no misunderstandings or misinterpretations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4.3 Reporting process</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The draft version of the audit report is issued within 7 working days after closing of the audit. The report has a chapter with recommendations from the audit. The addressee of the audit report signs for receipt and has the obligation to give written comments (including actions on the audit recommendations) within seven working days after receipt of the report. The final version of the report is issued within three weeks after closing of the audit and includes the comments of the auditee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.4 Review the management action plan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internal auditor reviews the management action plan to determine whether it adequately addresses the recommendations. The action plan should indicate an agreement with the recommendation and a commitment to undertake corrective action or agreement with the recommendation and an explanation as to why corrective action cannot be taken at this time or disagreement with the recommendation together with an explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4.5 Reporting to the Musoni Kenya Audit Committee</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chief Internal Auditor serves as a secretariat to the Audit Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a quarterly basis the Chief Internal Auditor presents to the Audit Committee all items listed as the standing agenda and any other documents as requested by the Audit Committee. The main papers presented to the Audit Committee include the summary of issues raised from the reports for that particular quarter, implementation status report showing the status of implementation of issues raised from the previous quarter, the audit reports for that quarter and the progress on the budgeted activities for that particular quarter. (See annex 2 for the format reports to the Audit Committee)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4.6 Workflow overview</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Continuously: performance of audits</li>\r\n	<li>One business week after the audit: send draft audit report to the audited</li>\r\n	<li>Two weeks after the audit: comments by the audited on the report</li>\r\n	<li>Three weeks after the audit: audit report to be sent to the CEO</li>\r\n	<li>Every quarter (before a board meeting): send all audit reports to the Audit Committee of the board</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>4.7 Audit files reporting format</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the file of every audit, the following elements are documented (see annex 3 for the format):</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Origin of the audit (reference to the audit plan or the audit request)</li>\r\n	<li>Hours likely to be spent (as given in the audit plan or in the audit request)</li>\r\n	<li>Hours actually spent</li>\r\n	<li>Reference to the applicable Musoni manuals</li>\r\n	<li>Auditor understanding of the work to be done</li>\r\n	<li>Short description of work done</li>\r\n	<li>Staff interviewed</li>\r\n	<li>Audit findings</li>\r\n	<li>Substantiation of recommendations made</li>\r\n	<li>Draft report</li>\r\n	<li>Comments on the draft report</li>\r\n	<li>Final report</li>\r\n	<li>Follow-up on recommendations made</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>5.0 Risk-Based Audit planning</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The internal audit undertakes the annual risk-based audit planning process to determine the internal audit priorities for upcoming year which should be consistent with the organization&#39;s goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5.1 Overview of the Risk-Based Audit Planning Process</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The process starts with the determination of the audit universe and the individual auditable units within Musoni universe. The internal audit selects the key risk factors as a criteria in selecting high risk branches. The input of the Audit Committee and the management is considered at this stage. The results of the risk assessment from the risk matrix are also used to compile the annual plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5.2 The Audit Universe</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Musoni audit universe is made up of all departments, functions and the operational office locations which include the branches and the satellite offices. All plans for expansion are a major key factor considered during this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5.3 The Planning Framework</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The planning framework involves two stages as explained below;-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Developing the generic risk factors</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In developing the generic risk factors from the auditable units the internal audit seeks input from the Audit Committee the management and the Board. The following are the factors that are taken into consideration in the process;-</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>a) Developing generic risk factors from auditable units</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In developing the generic risk factors for the auditable units, within Musoni audit universe, internal audit considers the alignment of the organizational objectives to the annual internal audit plan. Every year, the Internal Audit department, the Audit Committee and the management agree on the selected key risk factors and use them as a criterion in selecting high risk locations. The following factors are considered annually although there is an open mind to include any other risk factor as will be observed by the stakeholders;-</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>a) Growth in the number of loans</li>\r\n	<li>b) Growth in Outstanding Loan</li>\r\n	<li>c) Status of the Portfolio at Risk (PAR)</li>\r\n	<li>d) Total staff exits as a percentage of the total staff per location</li>\r\n	<li>e) Total write-offs</li>\r\n	<li>f) The trend in collateral funds for any unusual increase or decrease</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>b) Scoring of the auditable units based on the of risk factors</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>All the branch locations are analysed based on the risk factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the locations are ranked based on each of the risk factors. The location with the highest amount on any of the risk factors, is awarded a score of 15 with that with the least awarded a score of 1. The individual scores from each of the risk factors are summed up to give a total score which gives the final score.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The location with a high score falls on the first closer signifying high risk</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unit, the second category is made up of medium risk unit and the location with a low score signifies low risk unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Reviewing Musoni Risk register</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The second stage of the audit planning is&nbsp; reviewing Musoni risk register and identifying high levels of residual risks that need to be factored into the annual audit planning.&nbsp; Internal audit recognizes that Musoni Board and management has&nbsp; put in placea risk management process.&nbsp; Internal Audit examins the risk matrix to see what individual risks have been identified by management and the action being taken to address these risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internal audit reviews the risk register to understand the events that the managers has identified. During the review, the Internal Auditor considers&nbsp; accuracy, completeness and review the events that have been scored and actions that had been put in place to address the risks and considered effectiveness of risk mitigation actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5.4 The Planning approach</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In November of each year, the auditor makes a draft audit plan for the following year (see annex 4 for the planning format). The plan is presented to the management. There is a general assumption that always the annual plan should reflect at least over 65% of the available planned days should be planned for operational audits while at least 35% should be planned for the other audits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>75% of available working days are planned for in the audit plan and the remaining 25% is spare capacity for ad hoc audit work such as audit requests stemming from unusual patterns in transactions, presumption of misconduct and/or incidents that need further investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5.5 Audit plan approval</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The audit plan needs approval of the Musoni Kenya CEO and management in the first instance and sent to the Chair of the Audit Committee latest on the 10th&nbsp;of December. If this Committee demands no changes, the audit plan is final as of January 1. In case the Audit Committee wants to change the plan, they will do so before the end of January the following year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5.6 Deviation from the audit plan</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If the reserved 25% spare capacity does not suffice, the auditor seeks guidance from the Audit Committee on where to deviate from the original audit plan. The written approval by the CEO for deviation of the audit plan is always copied to the Audit Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>5.7 Audit plan workflow</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>November: auditor prepares the annual audit plan</li>\r\n	<li>Before 10 December: approval by the CEO</li>\r\n	<li>Up to 15 December: approval by the Audit Committee</li>\r\n	<li>1 January: start of the audit plan</li>\r\n	<li>Before 31 January: start audit plan in case it is adapted by the Audit Committee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.8 Budgeted versus the plan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every quarter, the internal audit presents the budgeted versus the audit plan to the Audit Committee. See annex 9 for the format used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>6.0 Audit approach</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.1 General approach</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The audits are risk based.<a href=\"http://documents.musoni.co.ke/wp-admin/post.php?post=30&amp;action=edit#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;Most audit time is therefore spent on issues that are deemed higher risk both inherent and residual risk. For the start situation, the Audit Committee defines the risk perception. This risk perception and the time involvement to audit them are based on the maturity of the IT systems, on the maturity of the operational procedures and on the available audit time. The audit plan will be drawn up by the Musoni Kenya auditor under the responsibility of the Audit Committee as &sect;4.1 above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.2 Fine-tuning the audit plan</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on experience with the maturing organisation, the audit plan will be fine-tuned in due course. This fine-tuning is the joint responsibility of the internal auditor and the Audit Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.3 Access</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Musoni Kenya Internal Auditor has full, free, and unrestricted access to all levels of management, the records (manual and electronic), property, and personnel of Musoni. The internal auditor has always access to the chair of the Musoni Kenya Audit committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.4 Organisation of the audit</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the board minutes and on the relevant parts of the manuals, the auditor makes a risk assessment of the different procedures, processes and transactions used and performed in Musoni. Based on these risk assessment, 75% of available and planned audit time is spent on perceived high-risk situations and the remaining 25% on all other situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.5 Checking frequency</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The audit approach is to check adherence to procedures by looking at processes and transactions. All procedures with perceived high risk are checked at least every quarter (see &sect;5.1 above). All other procedures are at least checked in a two-year cycle. It is noted that checking of several processes or procedures can be combined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from checking adherence to procedures, the auditor also checks the usefulness and efficiency of the procedures. General recommendations regarding procedures are sent to the Musoni Kenya CEO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.6 Developing audit programme</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Audit programs document and detail the audit tests and procedures that the audit manager has designed as the approach to collect and analyse audit evidence while ensuring objectivity, independence and uniformity. The purpose of the audit programme is to provide (See annex 6 for a format for an Internal Audit Programme):</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A guide for conducting and coordinating the audit work to be done</li>\r\n	<li>A framework for assigning audit work and effectively supervising work and assessing the cost and the quality of the work performed</li>\r\n	<li>A vehicle to document the exercise of due care and compliance with professional standards and policies.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.7 Carrying out audits</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To plan and prepare for an audit engagement, the Internal Auditor conducts the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Notify the audited of the proposed scheduled engagement start date at least one week in advance (unless it is a surprise visit)(see annex 7: format audit notification).</li>\r\n	<li>Obtain an understanding of the business to be audited by researching background information such as management reports</li>\r\n	<li>Determinethe auditable activities based upon the entity&rsquo;s risk (see &sect;5.1 above)</li>\r\n	<li>Determine the resources necessary to perform the audit in terms of time, data, applicable procedures/manuals and transport</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the start of the engagement the auditor discusses with the audited (note that the auditor could decide to limit the level of detail revealed to the audited, for instance in case of a surprise visit):</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The planned scope and objectives of the audit</li>\r\n	<li>Special concerns and requests</li>\r\n	<li>Key risks and control points</li>\r\n	<li>Follow-up</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general terms, the audit is carried out using the following steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Determining the standard procedure/process/transaction</li>\r\n	<li>Compare the standard to the observed practice, by analysing actual processes and transactions</li>\r\n	<li>Assessing the involved risks of differences between the standard and the observed practice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>During the audit process, the audit staff is expected to fill in a timesheet form on a daily basis. (See annex 10 for time sheet format).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.8 The Risk Committee and ALCO</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk Committee and ALCO minutes are checked by the auditor on compliance with company standards and legal obligations. The Musoni auditor checks liquidity against the legal liquidity requirement. The auditor performs the same check for other financial requirements discussed in the Risk Committee and ALCO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.9 The Credit committee</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit Committee minutes are checked by the auditor on compliance with company standards and legal obligations. The loan approval, loan conditions, loan disbursement, loan performance and the existence of loans are perceived as high-risk situations. Strict adherence to procedures is checked (see Manual 02: Lending and Credit). Existence and correctness of loans is controlled by checking a sample of the loan portfolio on accurateness with the beneficiary of the loan details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proper filling of the customer data is also perceived as a potential risk situation. Strict adherence to the data recording procedures is checked (see Manual 02: Lending and Credit).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.10 Assets</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At least once a year, the internal auditor checks existence of physical assets that are on the books of Musoni Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.11 Liabilities</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At least once a year existence of liabilities that are on the books of Musoni Kenya is checked. Mandatory savings and pledged savings are perceived as potential risk situations. Strict adherence to procedures is checked (see Manual 03: Savings).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.12 MIS</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Strict adherence is checked quarterly to the separation of functions as described in Manual 11: MIS and as fixed in the MIS. Also adherence of the procedure for administrator password usage is checked quarterly by the internal auditor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.13 Costs and income</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Twice a year a sample of expenses and other costs, which are solely on the books of Musoni, are checked by the auditor on adherence to procedures, proper authorisation and on unusual expense patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proper and timely posting of fee and interest income is perceived as a high-risk situation. Strict adherence to procedures is checked (see Manual 07: Accounting). Twice a year, proper and timely booking of income, which is solely on the books of Musoni, is checked by the auditor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.14 Payment processes</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At least once a month payment processes as described in Manual 07: Accounting, are checked by the auditor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>6.15 Suspense accounts</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All transactions that are not immediately booked or where certain issues are unclear are temporarily placed on the suspense account. Items placed on this account are checked by the accountant or book-keeper and, when possible, are placed on the proper account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suspense account activities are considered potentially high risk. At least once a month, all suspense account entries are therefore checked by the internal auditor on open items and, on a sample basis, on timely and proper solving of incoming items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>7.0.&nbsp; Special investigations</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>7.1 Potential fraudulent activities</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The auditor investigates in more detail activities that he perceives as potentially fraudulent or otherwise inappropriate. All suspicions are shared with the chair of the Audit Committee quarterly, or earlier if deemed necessary by the auditor. More serious suspicious are shared with the CEO, but not with other employees within or outside Musoni Kenya (see chapter 7).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>7.2 Responsibility</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The auditor is responsible for investigating any suspected process or transaction that may arise. The auditor is also responsible for reporting upon these cases to the management and for recommending solutions to avoid possible future missteps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>7.3 Nature of fraudulent activities</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Fraudulent activities are defined as activities that lead to illicit gains by the fraudster, both in terms of money or otherwise. Musoni considers fraud a criminal offence. Employees involved in fraudulent activities will be fired and, if possible, charged with fraud. Musoni uses a zero tolerance policy (see Manual 04: Human Resource Development). Making mistakes or misbehaviour is not necessarily considered a fraudulent activity, even though the involved employee(s) might be disciplined for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>7.4 Investigation process</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Information: allegations of fraud or breaches of procedures could come from different sources, for instance through observations of other employees, management, clients, the external auditors or business partners. It is noted that Manual 04: Human Resource Development obliges all employees to inform Musoni if they see potential fraudulent activities.</li>\r\n	<li>Recording the allegations:&nbsp;the auditor records all received allegations confidentially. An allegation may be recorded anonymously, although preferably not.</li>\r\n	<li>Investigation: the auditor will investigate all allegations. The timing of the investigation is decided by the auditor based on perceived seriousness of the allegation.</li>\r\n	<li>Decision: when fraudulent acts are discovered, the auditor reports to the CEO and the Audit Committee, including a recommendation. Decisions about what to do are taken by the management, including the possibility for prosecution.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>7.5 The actual investigation</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The investigation procedure is as followings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Secure information: including documents, computer prints and written down interviews or statements</li>\r\n	<li>Analyse information: the case is terminated where there is no perceived risk of fraud. In case there is a serious indication that a fraudulent act happened the case is discussed with the management. The main goal of the discussion is to decide how the matter should be progressed. The Audit Committee is informed about the allegations latest at this stage of the process.</li>\r\n	<li>Decision: by the management. This could include temporary suspension of the employee to perform additional research. In case fraud is discovered, the involved employee(s) is always fired, and prosecuted if possible.</li>\r\n	<li>Research additional information: if needed</li>\r\n	<li>Formal reporting: to the Audit Committee.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>7.6 Reporting</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important that fraud is properly reported upon. This report also serves as a learning tool for the auditor and the management to avoid future fraud. Anne5 gives the fraud report overview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>7.7 Techniques for obtaining evidence</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Employee profiling: certain types of employees or certain functions are more prone to misbehave. Once Musoni has enough employees, the auditor will make such a risk profiling.</li>\r\n	<li>Using the database: with the help of the database odd transactions and odd transaction patterns can be discerned by using automated database queries. This helps determining which employees or processes need more attention by the auditor.</li>\r\n	<li>Observations: the actual fieldwork, checking if procedures are being followed by going through processes and transactions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>8.0. Confidentiality</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>8.1 Filing of audit reports</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All audit reports/data and files are kept locked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>8.2 Confidentiality</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A fraud is only a fraud when there is clear fraud case. In all other cases there might either be misunderstanding or misconduct, with possible disciplinary measures. In these cases, the fraud investigation is stopped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important that the auditor and others who are involved in the investigation keep their information confidential as not to destroy relations and careers (and evidence).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Annex 1: Audit report (Form 8.1)</h1>\r\n\r\n<table
